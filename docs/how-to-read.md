# How to read this guidebook

This guidebook is not intended to be read linearly.

It is designed as a **reference for reasoning and governance**, where different readers may engage with different parts depending on their role, intent, and level of familiarity.

This page defines the **rules of interpretation** for the entire guidebook.



## The structure of the guidebook

The guidebook is organized into four main **parts**:

- Motivation
- Foundations
- Guidelines
- Resources

Each part has a distinct role and carries a different normative weight.

Understanding these distinctions is essential for using the guidebook correctly.


## The role of each part


### Motivation

The **[Motivation](./motivation/index.md)** part explains **why Upstream Software Engineering is needed**.

It describes the problem space and the limitations observed in current practice that motivate the formulation of a dedicated discipline to govern software systems over time.

Motivation is **pre-normative**.

It prepares the reader for the definitions introduced later, but it does not define validity or impose obligations.


### Foundations

The **[Foundations](./foundations/index.md)** part defines the **normative core** of Upstream Software Engineering.

It includes:

- **[The discipline](./foundations/discipline/index.md)** — the formal definition of Upstream Software Engineering, including its scope and boundaries
- **[The metamodel](./foundations/metamodel/index.md)** — the normative conceptual structure that defines the concepts, relationships, and constraints used to reason about software systems and their evolution
- **[The plays](./foundations/plays/index.md)** — the valid transformation patterns that operate over models conforming to the metamodel

Foundations answer the question:

> What is considered valid within this discipline?

Statements in this part are **normative**.

Compliance is assessed **only** against Foundations.


### Guidelines

The **[Guidelines](./guidelines/index.md)** part provides **recommended ways** to enact the Foundations in practice.

It includes:

- **[The artifacts](./guidelines/artifacts/index.md)** — suggested ways of representing, documenting, or managing models that conform to the metamodel
- **[The practices](./guidelines/practices/index.md)** — situational ways of executing plays in concrete organizational contexts

Guidelines answer the question:

> How can the normative core be enacted in real contexts?

Content in this part is **non-normative**.

Guidelines are optional and adaptable.

Different practitioners and tool builders may choose different representations, as long as the underlying models conform to the metamodel defined in the **Foundations**.


### Resources

The **[Resources](./resources/index.md)** part provides **downloadable and reusable materials** produced as part of this initiative.

It includes white papers, research papers, books, templates, canvases, multimedia, and other artifacts intended to be used, adapted, or cited.

Resources are **informative only** and have **no normative force**.


## Normativity and compliance

Not all content in this guidebook has the same normative force.

- **Normative**
  - Discipline
  - Metamodel
  - Plays

- **Guiding**
  - Artifacts
  - Practices

- **Informative**
  - Motivation
  - Resources

Only the content in **Foundations** defines validity.

Only Foundations are subject to compliance assessment.

Guidelines may inform governance decisions, but they do not impose obligations.


## Language and interpretation

Language is used deliberately.

- Normative statements describe what *is* or what *is considered valid*
- Guiding statements describe what *may be useful*, *common*, or *recommended*
- Informative content provides context and support

Recommendations should not be interpreted as requirements.


## How to navigate the guidebook

The guidebook supports multiple reading paths.

- **First-time readers**  
  Start with this page, then read **[Motivation](./motivation/index.md)**.

- **Architects and technical leads**  
  Use **[Foundations](./foundations/index.md)** as a reference; consult **[Guidelines](./guidelines/index.md)** selectively.

- **Governance roles**  
  Focus on **[Foundations](./foundations/index.md)** → **[The plays](./foundations/plays/index.md)**, using **[Guidelines](./guidelines/index.md)** for context.

- **Researchers and educators**  
  Read **[Foundations](./foundations/index.md)** in full; treat **[Guidelines](./guidelines/index.md)** and **[Resources](./resources/index.md)** as supporting material.

Selective and iterative reading is expected.


## Using the guidebook in context

The guidebook itself is **not a deliverable**.

Concrete outputs—such as project documents, internal representations, or customer-facing materials—are created **outside** the guidebook.

The guidebook defines:

- the conceptual structures
- the valid transformations
- and recommended ways of working

Their instantiation is always **context-dependent**.


## Versions and evolution

This guidebook evolves over time.

Each released version represents a **stable and reviewable state**.

Changes are introduced incrementally, and prior versions remain valid references.

Readers should always consider **which version** is being used when making normative claims.


## Summary

In summary:

- Use this page to understand **how to interpret the guidebook**
- Read **[Motivation](./motivation/index.md)** to understand why the discipline is needed
- Use **[Foundations](./foundations/index.md)** to assess validity
- Consult **[Guidelines](./guidelines/index.md)** for practical inspiration
- Use **[Resources](./resources/index.md)** for reusable materials and further application

This separation enables governance **without rigidity**, and guidance **without prescription**.
