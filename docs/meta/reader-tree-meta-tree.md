# Reader Tree and Meta Tree

*This page defines the dual-tree structure of the guidebook and clarifies the separation between reader-facing content and contributor-facing governance.*

The guidebook is organized as two distinct but structurally consistent trees:

- The **Reader Tree**, intended for readers of the discipline.
- The **Meta Tree**, intended for contributors to the guidebook.

Both trees follow the same information architecture rules, but they serve different purposes and audiences.

---

## The Reader Tree

The Reader Tree contains the conceptual exposition of the discipline.

Its purpose is to:

- Present definitions and models.
- Develop arguments and analyses.
- Structure the discipline into coherent conceptual areas.
- Provide a canonical reading progression through the primary tree.

The Reader Tree is the guidebook proper.  
Its structure expresses the decomposition of the discipline.

Graph links and complementary material appear contextually, as defined in the Information Architecture.

## The Meta Tree

The Meta Tree governs the construction of the guidebook as an artifact.

Its purpose is to:

- Define structural conventions.
- Specify page obligations.
- Regulate navigation rules.
- Establish linking discipline.
- Guide contributors in maintaining coherence and homogeneity.

The Meta Tree is not part of the discipline.  
It is a governance layer over the guidebook itself.

## Structural Separation

The two trees are conceptually and navigationally distinct.

- Reader pages should not depend on Meta pages for conceptual understanding.
- Meta pages may reference Reader pages as examples.
- Navigation within each tree remains internal to that tree.

The Meta Tree does not redefine the discipline; it regulates how the discipline is documented.

---

## Reflexive Consistency

Both trees follow the same information architecture rules:

- Tree-based primary navigation.
- Contextual graph traversal.
- Contextual complementary deepening.
- Homogeneous page structure.
- Tree-only navigation in “Where to go next”.

The guidebook therefore demonstrates the architectural discipline it prescribes.

---

## Summary

The guidebook is structured as two coordinated trees:

- The **Reader Tree**, which expresses the discipline.
- The **Meta Tree**, which governs the guidebook artifact.

This separation preserves conceptual clarity for readers while ensuring structural rigor for contributors.
