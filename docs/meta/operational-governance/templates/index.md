# Templates

> This page defines the canonical authoring templates used to instantiate structurally compliant pages in the guidebook.

Templates are operational instruments.  They provide reusable scaffolding for constructing pages that comply with structural, editorial, and navigation rules.

Templates ensure disciplined instantiation of page types defined in the content model.

↗ **[Content model](../../structural-governance/content-model/)**  
  Defines the page types, structural obligations, and specialization rules that govern how content is constructed in the guidebook.


## Scope

Templates provide:

- Structural scaffolding aligned with the Content model.
- Navigation compliance with the Navigation format.
- Correct callout usage.
- Consistent section ordering.

Templates implement structural and editorial requirements.  They do not introduce new conceptual content.


## Available templates

The following templates are provided as complementary pages:

- **[Intermediate page template](./intermediate-page-template/)**  
  Provides the canonical structure for pages that contain other pages in the primary hierarchy.

- **[Leaf page template](./leaf-page-template/)**  
  Provides the canonical structure for pages that do not contain other pages.

- **[Complementary page template](./complementary-page-template/)**  
  Provides the canonical structure for pages that supplement tree nodes.

- **[Decision record template](./decision-record-template/)**  
  Provides the canonical structure for documenting governance decisions.


## Usage discipline

Templates must be used as starting points.  Contributors must not alter required structural sections unless the Content model explicitly permits it.

All placeholder paths and identifiers must be replaced before publication.


## Summary

Templates ensure structural compliance and editorial consistency.  They operationalize the Content model and Navigation format.


## Where to go next
