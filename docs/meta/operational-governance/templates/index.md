# Templates

> This page defines the canonical authoring templates used to instantiate structurally compliant pages in the guidebook.

Templates are operational instruments.  They provide reusable scaffolding for constructing pages that comply with structural, editorial, and navigation rules.

Templates ensure disciplined instantiation of page types defined in the content model.

↗ See **[Content model](../../structural-governance/content-model/)** for the structural types of pages and their specialization rules within the guidebook.


## Scope

Templates implement structural and editorial requirements.  They:

- Provide structural scaffolding aligned with the Content model.
- Ensure navigation compliance aligned with the Navigation format.
- Enforce descriptor and callout discipline aligned with the Callout standard.
- Preserve consistent section ordering and rendering rules.

↗ See **[Navigation format](../../structural-governance/information-architecture/navigation-format/)** for the rendering rules of the “Where to go next” section.

↗ See **[Callout standard](../../editorial-governance/callout-standard/)** for the normative system for structured callouts used throughout the guidebook.


## Structural page templates

- **[Container page template](./container-page-template/)**  
  Provides the canonical structure for pages that aggregate and contextualize contained pages within the primary hierarchy.

Additional templates may be introduced here as new structural or specialized page types are defined.


## Usage discipline

Templates must be used as starting points.  Contributors must not alter required structural sections unless the Content model explicitly permits it.

All placeholder paths and identifiers must be replaced before publication.

Templates must remain aligned with the structural rules defined in Structural governance.

↗ See **[Structural governance](../../structural-governance/)** for the structural rules that regulate page types, hierarchy, and navigation in the guidebook.
