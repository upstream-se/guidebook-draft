# Operational governance

> This page defines the processes, instruments, and decision mechanisms governing how issues and changes to the guidebook are proposed, reviewed, classified, and authorized.

Operational governance regulates how contributors engage with the guidebook governance system.  It defines how issues are introduced, how proposed changes are evaluated, how decisions are made, and how governance actions are recorded.

This domain ensures procedural clarity.  It prevents structural drift while enabling controlled and traceable evolution.


## Scope

Operational governance regulates:

- Issue intake and classification.
- Change impact classification.
- Workflow progression through defined stages.
- Decision authorization and escalation.
- Recording of governance decisions.
- Use of templates to ensure structural compliance.

It operationalizes structural and editorial rules.  It does not redefine conceptual structure, editorial standards, or lifecycle policies.


## Operational components

### Contribution intake

- **[Issue types](./issue-types/)**  
  Defines the categories of issues that may be opened and their procedural implications.

### Change processing

- **[Change classification](./change-classification/)**  
  Defines the impact categories of changes and their governance consequences.

- **[Contribution workflow](./contribution-workflow/)**  
  Defines the stages through which issues and changes progress, including reporting, classification, review, approval, and escalation.

### Authority

- **[Roles and authority](./roles-and-authority/)**  
  Defines governance actors and their decision rights within the workflow.

### Operational instruments

- **[Templates](./templates/)**  
  Defines the canonical authoring templates used to instantiate compliant pages.

- **[Decision records](./decision-records/)**  
  Defines how governance decisions are documented and preserved.
