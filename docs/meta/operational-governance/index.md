# Operational governance

> This page defines the processes, instruments, and decision mechanisms governing how changes to the guidebook are proposed, reviewed, and approved.

Operational governance defines how contributors interact with the guidebook governance system.  It establishes how issues are raised, how changes are classified, how proposals move through review stages, and how authority is exercised.

This domain ensures procedural clarity.  It prevents structural drift while enabling controlled evolution.


## Scope

Operational governance regulates:

- How issues are opened and categorized.
- How proposed changes are classified.
- How proposals progress through review stages.
- How decisions are authorized.
- How governance decisions are recorded.
- How templates are used to ensure structural compliance.

It operationalizes structural and editorial rules.  It does not redefine them.

  Defines the stages through which issues and changes progress, including reporting, classification, review, approval, and escalation.

### Authority

- **[Roles and authority](./roles-and-authority/)**  
  Defines governance actors and their decision rights within the workflow.
