# Content model

> This page defines the structural types of pages and their specialization rules within the guidebook.

The content model defines how pages are constructed and how they relate structurally.  It specifies the base page type and its specialized forms.  These types regulate structural obligations and navigation behavior.

The content model governs form.  It does not regulate language modality or editorial tone.


## Relation to information architecture

The content model defines page types and their structural obligations.  Information architecture defines how pages are organized and navigated as a graph with a primary hierarchy.

The content model constrains what a page must contain.  Information architecture constrains how pages are connected, traversed, and referenced.

↗ See **[Information architecture](../information-architecture/)** for how knowledge is organized and navigated, including structural topology and linking conventions.


## Types of pages

### Base type

- **[Page](./page/)**  
  Defines the base structural type from which all page types specialize.  
  Establishes the structural invariants that apply to every page.


### Structural page types

- **[Container page](./container-page/)**  
  Defines pages that aggregate and contextualize contained pages within the primary hierarchy.  
  Useful for organizing related content and providing conceptual framing.

- **[Content page](./content-page/)**  
  Defines pages that develop a single conceptual, normative, or procedural unit without containing other pages.  
  Useful for presenting focused, self-contained material.

- **[Complementary page](./complementary-page/)**  
  Defines pages that deepen or supplement another page.  
  Useful for presenting auxiliary material that supports understanding but does not warrant placement in the primary hierarchy.


### Specialized page types

Specialized page types impose additional structural constraints for specific kinds of content.  They allow the guidebook to express domain-specific page forms while preserving the base structural model.
