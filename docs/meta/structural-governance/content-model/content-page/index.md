# Content page

> This page defines the structural obligations of pages that do not contain other pages in the primary hierarchy.

A content page develops a single conceptual, normative, or procedural unit.  It provides a complete treatment of its scope within the primary hierarchy.

Content pages are structurally non-containing but conceptually substantive.


## Definition

A content page is a Page that:

- Does not contain other pages in the primary hierarchy.
- Corresponds to a directory containing an `index.md` file.
- May contain complementary pages in the same directory.
- Develops its subject matter within a bounded scope.


## Structural obligations

In addition to the invariants defined for Page, a content page must:

- Include one or more substantive sections developing its content.
- Include a section titled “Summary”.
- Not include a section that lists contained pages.


## Conceptual responsibility

A content page must:

- Clearly develop its subject.
- Maintain a bounded and coherent scope.
- Avoid introducing artificial containment or hierarchy.

A content page may reference complementary pages contextually within its body.  Such references must not appear in the “Where to go next” section.


## Relationship with complementary pages

Complementary pages may reside in the same directory as a content page.  They deepen, justify, or contextualize its material.

The presence of complementary pages does not alter the structural role of a content page.


## Summary

A content page develops a focused conceptual, normative, or procedural unit within the primary hierarchy.  It does not contain other pages and must include a Summary section, while referencing complementary pages only contextually.


## Where to go next

← **[Container page](../container-page/)**  
  Defines pages that aggregate and contextualize contained pages within the primary hierarchy.

→ **[Complementary page](../complementary-page/)**  
  Defines pages that deepen or supplement another page.

↑ **[Content model](../)**  
  Defines the structural types of pages and their specialization rules within the guidebook.

↑ **[Structural governance](../../)**  
  Defines the structural rules that regulate page types, hierarchy, and navigation in the guidebook.

↑ **[Guidebook governance](../../../)**  
  Defines the governance framework that regulates the structure, authorship, evolution, and authority of the guidebook.
