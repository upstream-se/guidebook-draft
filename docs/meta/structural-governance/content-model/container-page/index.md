# Container page

> This page defines the structural obligations of pages that contain other pages in the primary hierarchy.

A container page aggregates and contextualizes other pages within the primary hierarchy.  It combines conceptual exposition with structural responsibility.

Container pages provide orientation.  They define scope, boundaries, and relationships among their contained pages.


## Definition

A container page is a Page that:

- Has one or more contained pages in the primary hierarchy.
- Corresponds to a directory containing an `index.md` file.
- Lists its directly contained pages in a dedicated section.
- Participates fully in hierarchical navigation.


## Structural obligations

In addition to the invariants defined for Page, a container page must:

- Provide substantive sections introducing its conceptual scope.
- Include a section that enumerates the pages directly contained within it.
- Reference its first contained page in the navigation section.

The section that enumerates contained pages must:

- Use bold links.
- Reuse the child descriptor without the phrase “This page”.
- Avoid paraphrasing the descriptor.

The section title used for listing contained pages must be conceptually meaningful.  It must not be mechanically titled unless such wording is substantively appropriate.


## Conceptual responsibility

A container page must provide:

- Conceptual orientation for its domain.
- Clarification of scope and boundaries.
- Explanation of how contained pages relate to each other.

A container page must not:

- Exist solely to split a long list.
- Introduce artificial hierarchy.
- Duplicate content from its contained pages.

Containment must be conceptually justified, not editorially convenient.


## Editorial grouping

Editorial grouping within the contained-page listing is permitted to improve readability or thematic clarity.

Editorial groups:

- Do not imply additional hierarchy.
- Do not require corresponding directories.
- Do not create additional structural nodes.
- Must not alter navigation structure.

Grouping is rhetorical, not structural.


## Summary

A container page aggregates and contextualizes related pages within the primary hierarchy.  It provides conceptual framing while fulfilling structural containment responsibilities.
