# Intermediate page

> This page defines the structural obligations of pages that contain other pages in the primary hierarchy.

An intermediate page is a tree node that directly contains other tree nodes.  It contributes conceptual content while also serving as a structural container.

Intermediate pages are part of the primary hierarchy.  They must balance substantive exposition with structural indexing.


## Definition

An intermediate page is a page that:

- Has one or more contained pages in the primary hierarchy.
- Corresponds to a directory containing an `index.md` file.
- Lists its contained pages using the descriptor reuse convention.
- Provides canonical navigation through the “Where to go next” section.

An intermediate page is not merely a listing.  It must provide conceptual framing for its contained pages.


## Structural obligations

An intermediate page must include:

- A descriptor callout immediately after the H1 title.
- One or more substantive sections introducing its conceptual scope.
- A section that enumerates the pages directly contained within it.
- A “Where to go next” section at the end of the page.

The section that enumerates contained pages must:

- Use bold links.
- Reuse the child descriptor without the phrase “This page”.
- Preserve indentation discipline.
- Avoid paraphrasing the descriptor.

The section title used for listing contained pages must be conceptually meaningful.  It must not be mechanically titled “Contained pages” unless such wording is substantively appropriate.


## Conceptual responsibility

An intermediate page must provide:

- Conceptual orientation for its domain.
- Clarification of scope and boundaries.
- Explanation of how contained pages relate to each other.

It must not:

- Exist solely to split a long list.
- Introduce artificial hierarchy.
- Duplicate content from its contained pages.


## Relationship with editorial grouping

Editorial grouping within the contained-page listing is permitted.  Groups may be introduced to improve readability or thematic clarity.

However, editorial groups:

- Do not imply additional hierarchy.
- Do not require corresponding directories.
- Do not create additional tree nodes.
- Must not alter navigation structure.

Grouping is rhetorical, not structural.


## Navigation constraints

The “Where to go next” section of an intermediate page must:

- Identify the first contained page.
- Identify its parent page.
- Maintain tree-only traversal.

Complementary pages and contextual graph links must not appear in this section.  They must be placed contextually within the page body.
