# Complementary page

> This page defines the structural obligations of pages that deepen or supplement another page.

A complementary page provides auxiliary material that supports, justifies, or expands the content of another page.  It exists to deepen understanding without introducing new structural containment.

Complementary pages are structurally independent but contextually attached.


## Definition

A complementary page is a Page that:

- Does not appear as a contained page in the primary hierarchy.
- Resides in the same directory as the page it complements.
- Is referenced contextually within the complemented page.
- Develops supporting or auxiliary material.


## Structural obligations

In addition to the invariants defined for Page, a complementary page must:

- Clearly identify the page it complements.
- Maintain a bounded auxiliary scope.
- Include a section titled “Summary”.
- Include a “Where to go next” section containing only the complemented page.

A complementary page must not:

- List contained pages.
- Introduce sibling navigation.
- Introduce hierarchical traversal beyond the complemented page.


## Conceptual responsibility

A complementary page exists to:

- Provide justification, rationale, examples, extended analysis, or formal detail.
- Support comprehension of the complemented page.
- Preserve clarity in the primary hierarchy by isolating auxiliary depth.

Complementary material must be substantial enough to warrant separation, yet not foundational enough to require placement in the primary hierarchy.


## Summary

A complementary page deepens or supplements another page by presenting auxiliary material in a bounded and structurally independent form.  It maintains a single navigational link back to the page it complements.
