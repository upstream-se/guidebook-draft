# Intermediate page

> ■ Requirement — Child Index
Intermediate pages must include a section that enumerates the pages directly contained under them.  The section title must be conceptually appropriate and context-sensitive.

> ■ Requirement — Conceptual Node Justification
A grouping must become a distinct intermediate page only if it carries independent conceptual significance.
Editorial grouping alone does not justify the creation of a primary tree node.
