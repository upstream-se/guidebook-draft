# Structural governance

> This page defines the structural rules that govern how the guidebook is organized, modeled, and navigated.

Structural governance regulates the architecture of the guidebook as a structured hypertext artifact.  It defines how pages relate to each other, how conceptual hierarchy is established, how navigation is constrained, and how structural integrity is preserved.

This domain ensures that the guidebook remains coherent, navigable, and architecturally disciplined as it evolves.


## Structural scope

Structural governance regulates:

- The topology of the guidebook.
- The composition rules for pages.
- The classification of conceptual entities.
- The treatment of sources and interpretative decisions.
- The invariants that preserve architectural coherence.

These rules constrain all editorial and operational decisions.


## Structural components

- **[Information architecture](./information-architecture/)**  
  Defines the structural topology, navigation model, and relational conventions of the guidebook.

- **[Content model](./content-model/)**  
  Defines the page types, structural obligations, and specialization rules that govern how content is constructed in the guidebook.

- **[Concept taxonomy](./concept-taxonomy/)**  
  Defines the classification rules for conceptual entities in the guidebook.

- **[Provenance and traceability](./provenance-and-traceability/)**  
  Defines how sources, interpretations, and structural decisions are recorded and traced.
