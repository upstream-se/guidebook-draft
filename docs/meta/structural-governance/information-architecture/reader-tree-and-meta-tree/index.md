# Reader tree and meta tree

> This page defines the dual-tree structure of the guidebook and clarifies the separation between reader-facing content and contributor-facing governance.

The guidebook is organized as two distinct but structurally consistent trees:

- The Reader Tree, intended for readers of the discipline.
- The Meta Tree, intended for contributors to the guidebook.

Both trees follow the same information architecture rules, but they serve different purposes and audiences.


## The reader tree

The Reader Tree contains the conceptual exposition of the discipline.

Its purpose is to:

- Present definitions and models.
- Develop arguments and analyses.
- Structure the discipline into coherent conceptual areas.
- Provide canonical traversal through the primary hierarchy.

The Reader Tree constitutes the guidebook proper.  Its structure expresses the decomposition of the discipline.

Graph links and complementary material appear contextually, as governed by structural and editorial rules.


## The meta tree

The Meta Tree governs the construction of the guidebook as an artifact.

Its purpose is to:

- Define structural conventions.
- Specify page obligations.
- Regulate navigation rules.
- Establish linking discipline.
- Guide contributors in maintaining coherence and homogeneity.

The Meta Tree is not part of the discipline.  It is a governance layer over the guidebook itself.


## Structural separation

The two trees are conceptually and navigationally distinct.

- Reader pages must not depend on Meta pages for conceptual understanding.
- Meta pages may reference Reader pages as examples.
- Hierarchical navigation remains internal to each tree.
- Cross-references must not blur tree boundaries.

This separation preserves reader clarity while maintaining contributor rigor.


## Reflexive consistency

Both trees follow the same architectural principles:

- Tree-based primary navigation.
- Contextual graph traversal.
- Complementary auxiliary pages.
- Homogeneous page structure.
- Hierarchy-only traversal in “Where to go next”.

The guidebook therefore demonstrates the structural discipline it prescribes.


## Summary

The guidebook is structured as two coordinated trees:

- The Reader Tree, which expresses the discipline.
- The Meta Tree, which governs the guidebook artifact.

This separation ensures conceptual clarity for readers and structural integrity for contributors.


## Where to go next

→ **[Navigation format](../navigation-format/)**  
  Defines the rendering rules and traversal order governing hierarchical navigation in the guidebook.

↑ **[Information architecture](../)**  
  Defines how knowledge is organized, structured, and navigated within the guidebook.

↑ **[Structural governance](../../)**  
  Defines the structural rules that regulate page types, hierarchy, and navigation in the guidebook.

↑ **[Guidebook governance](../../../)**  
  Defines the governance framework that regulates the structure, authorship, evolution, and authority of the guidebook.
