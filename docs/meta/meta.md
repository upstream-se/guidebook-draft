# Meta-Governance Structure

This section governs the guidebook itself.

While the guidebook defines concepts, lenses, and analytical families for software governance, the **meta layer** defines how those artifacts are structured, reviewed, evolved, and maintained.

This page provides a structural map of the meta-governance taxonomy.  
It is intentionally high-level and may evolve as governance matures.

---

# 1. Purpose of the Meta Layer

The meta layer ensures that the guidebook:

- Remains conceptually coherent.
- Preserves terminological precision.
- Evolves in a controlled and traceable manner.
- Distinguishes clearly between normative and informative content.
- Maintains architectural integrity across pages and families.

Meta-governance is not editorial decoration.  
It is the governance of the governance artifact.

# 2. Meta-Governance Domains

The meta layer is structured into the following domains.

## 2.1 System Charter

Defines the identity and boundaries of the guidebook.

Includes:

- Mission and scope
- Audience definition
- Normativity policy
- Decision principles
- Explicit non-goals

---

## 2.2 Information Architecture

Defines how knowledge is organized and navigated.

Includes:

- Site topology (foundations, families, lenses, etc.)
- Concept graph conventions
- Navigation policies (including the “Where to Go Next” section)
- Cross-linking rules
- Indexing and registries

---

## 2.3 Content Model

Defines what kinds of pages exist and how they must be structured.

Includes:

- Page types
- Required sections per type
- Epistemic roles
- Stability levels
- Canonical templates

---

## 2.4 Editorial Standards

Defines language and style constraints to prevent drift.

Includes:

- Terminology governance
- Naming conventions
- Tone and modality rules
- Formatting standards
- Citation policy

---

## 2.5 Contribution Workflow

Defines how changes are proposed and integrated.

Includes:

- Contribution pathways
- Change classes
- Review levels
- Approval requirements
- Escalation mechanisms

---

## 2.6 Roles and Authority

Defines governance actors and decision rights.

Includes:

- Maintainers
- Reviewers
- Contributors
- Advisory roles
- Decision matrix

---

## 2.7 Quality Assurance

Defines control mechanisms and validation criteria.

Includes:

- Page quality checklists
- Structural consistency checks
- Terminology validation
- Drift detection
- Release readiness criteria

---

## 2.8 Release and Versioning

Defines how the guidebook evolves over time.

Includes:

- Versioning model
- Change log discipline
- Deprecation policy
- Breaking change handling
- Publication cadence

---

## 2.9 Provenance and Traceability

Defines how authority and decisions are documented.

Includes:

- Source registry
- Interpretation notes
- Definition decision logs
- External mapping tables
- Attribution rules

---

## 2.10 Tooling and Repository Operations

Defines operational and technical governance.

Includes:

- Repository structure conventions
- Branching strategy
- CI policies
- Automation rules
- Permissions and access control

---

# 3. Control Levels

Meta artifacts are classified by control level.

Each meta page must declare its level explicitly.

- **Policy** — Normative and enforceable.
- **Standard** — Strongly expected.
- **Guideline** — Recommended practice.
- **Template** — Canonical structural artifact.
- **Example** — Illustrative, non-binding.
- **Log** — Historical record.

This classification prevents all guidance from becoming equally rigid.

---

# 4. Evolution of the Meta Layer

The meta layer itself evolves.

Changes to:

- Normative definitions
- Page type structures
- Navigation logic
- Terminology policies

require explicit documentation in the appropriate meta domain.

The meta layer is expected to mature progressively.

This page serves as the temporary structural map guiding that evolution.

---

# 5. Where to Go Next

To define specific governance rules, explore:

→ **Content Model** — for page types and required sections.  
→ **Information Architecture** — for navigation and structural rules.  
→ **Contribution Workflow** — for change management processes.
