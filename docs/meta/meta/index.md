# Guidebook governance

> 
*This section defines the governance framework that regulates the structure, authorship, evolution, and authority of the guidebook.*

The guidebook is not merely a collection of pages. It is a governed intellectual artifact.  
This section defines the institutional framework that ensures its coherence, precision, authority, and controlled evolution.

Guidebook Governance establishes:

- Conceptual legitimacy.
- Structural integrity.
- Terminological discipline.
- Procedural control.
- Traceable evolution.

This governance framework applies to all reader-facing content and ensures that the guidebook remains consistent with its stated principles over time.

---

## Governance Layers

The governance framework is organized into five coordinated layers.

### 1. Constitutional Layer

Defines the identity and normative boundaries of the guidebook.

- Charter  
- Scope and Non-Goals  
- Decision Principles  
- Authority Model  

This layer establishes why the guidebook exists and who holds decision rights.

---

### 2. Structural Governance

Defines the epistemic structure of the guidebook.

- Information Architecture  
- Content Model  
- Concept Taxonomy  
- Provenance and Traceability  

This layer governs how knowledge is organized, modeled, and anchored to sources.

---

### 3. Editorial Governance

Defines semantic discipline and documentation standards.

- Editorial Standards  
- Terminology Governance  
- Citation and Source Policy  
- Control Levels  
- Quality Assurance  

This layer ensures conceptual precision, linguistic consistency, and normative clarity.

---

### 4. Operational Governance

Defines how change is proposed, reviewed, and approved.

- Contribution Workflow  
- Roles and Decision Rights  
- Change Classification  
- Review and Approval Mechanisms  

This layer governs the process through which the guidebook evolves.

---

### 5. Assurance and Evolution

Defines lifecycle management and structural integrity over time.

- Release and Versioning Model  
- Deprecation Policy  
- Change Log Discipline  
- Drift Detection and Structural Audits  
- Tooling and Repository Operations  

This layer ensures controlled evolution without structural degradation.

---

## Normative Status

Each governance artifact within these layers is classified by control level:

- **Policy** — Normative and enforceable.
- **Standard** — Strongly expected practice.
- **Guideline** — Recommended but context-dependent.
- **Template** — Canonical structural artifact.
- **Example** — Illustrative and non-binding.
- **Log** — Historical record.

Control levels clarify authority and prevent over-rigidity while preserving institutional discipline.

---

## Summary

The guidebook is governed through a layered framework that separates constitutional authority, structural modeling, editorial discipline, operational control, and lifecycle assurance.

This structure ensures that the guidebook evolves deliberately, coherently, and traceably.
