# Lifecycle governance

> This page defines the rules governing versioning, release discipline, deprecation, and controlled evolution of the guidebook.

Lifecycle governance regulates how the guidebook evolves over time.  It defines how versions are structured, how releases are authorized, how changes are communicated, and how deprecated content is managed.

This domain ensures temporal coherence.  It prevents uncontrolled drift across versions while preserving traceability.


## Scope

Lifecycle governance regulates:

- Version numbering and increment rules.
- Release criteria and publication discipline.
- Deprecation rules and retention policy.
- Change log structure and communication.
- Quality gates prior to release.

It governs the temporal dimension of the guidebook.  It does not regulate issue intake, editorial expression, or conceptual structure.


## Lifecycle components

### Version control

- **[Versioning model](./versioning-model/)**  
  Defines how guidebook versions are structured and incremented.

- **[Maintenance model](./maintenance-model/)**  
  Defines how Prior major version lines are maintained and when maintenance may be closed.


### Release discipline

- **[Release discipline](./release-discipline/)**  
  Defines release criteria, authorization requirements, and publication cadence.

- **[Quality assurance](./quality-assurance/)**  
  Defines structural validation, consistency checks, and release readiness criteria.

### Evolution control

- **[Deprecation policy](./deprecation-policy/)**  
  Defines how concepts, structures, and rules are deprecated and retained.

- **[Change log](./change-log/)**  
  Defines how released changes are documented and communicated across versions.
