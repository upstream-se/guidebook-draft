# Versioning model

> This page defines how guidebook versions are structured and incremented.

The guidebook is a normative artifact. Its versioning model is designed to preserve stability of the discipline’s core definitions while allowing controlled refinement of explanatory and guiding content.

Versioning ensures that:

- Normative claims remain reproducible.
- Compliance assessments can reference stable definitions.
- The discipline can evolve without silent drift.
- Readers can distinguish between structural change and editorial refinement.

Versions are expressed as:

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH


## Version number structure

Each released version represents a stable and reviewable state of the guidebook.

- **MAJOR** versions identify changes that affect the normative core of the discipline.
- **MINOR** versions identify non-normative changes or clarifications.
- **PATCH** versions identify editorial corrections that do not affect meaning.

Version increments are determined by the nature of the change, not by its size.


## Major version increments

A major version increment is required when changes alter the normative core of the discipline.

This includes:

- Modifications to formal definitions in Foundations.
- Changes to the metamodel.
- Changes to transformation plays.
- Any alteration that affects validity conditions.

Major versions are immutable once released.

Upon release of a new major version:

- The previous major version is archived.
- The new major version becomes the current reference.


## Minor version increments

A minor version increment is required for changes that do not alter the normative core but affect interpretation, explanation, or guidance.

This includes:

- Clarifications within Foundations that do not change validity conditions.
- Changes to Motivation, Guidelines, or Resources.
- Additions of informative material.
- Structural refinements that do not modify normative meaning.

Minor versions apply to the current major version and are recorded with an explicit version note.


## Patch increments

Patch increments are reserved for editorial corrections that do not affect meaning.

This includes:

- Typographical errors.
- Formatting corrections.
- Broken links.
- Non-substantive editorial fixes.

Patches do not introduce normative or interpretive change and may be applied without separate release announcements.


## Preview and forthcoming versions

Work on forthcoming major revisions is developed separately from the current released version.

A preview of the forthcoming major version may be made available under a dedicated path (e.g., `/next`).

Preview versions are not normative references. Normative claims must refer to a released major version.


## Archival and citation

All released major versions remain archived and accessible.

Normative claims, compliance assessments, and scholarly references must specify the major version to which they refer.

Minor and patch increments do not change the major version identifier.
