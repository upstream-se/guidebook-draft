# Versioning model

> This page defines how guidebook versions are structured and incremented.

The guidebook is a normative artifact.  Its versioning model is designed to preserve stability of the discipline’s core definitions while allowing controlled refinement of explanatory and guiding content.

Versioning ensures that:

- Normative claims remain reproducible.
- Compliance assessments can reference stable definitions.
- The discipline can evolve without silent drift.
- Readers can distinguish between structural change and editorial refinement.

Versions are expressed as:

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH


## Version number structure

Versions are expressed as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

Each **major version** of the guidebook represents a distinct normative state of the discipline.  It defines a stable configuration of Foundations against which validity and compliance may be assessed.

Each **minor version** represents a refinement of a major version.  It incorporates clarifications or non-normative improvements while preserving the normative state defined by the major version.

Each **patch version** represents an editorially corrected state of a minor version.  It addresses defects in expression without affecting interpretation or validity conditions.

A change in the MAJOR component occurs only when the normative core defined in Foundations changes.

A change in the MINOR component occurs when refinements or clarifications are introduced that do not alter validity conditions.

A change in the PATCH component occurs when editorial corrections are applied that do not affect meaning.

Minor and patch increments do not establish a new normative state.  Version increments are determined by the nature of the change, not by its size.


## Major version increments

A major version increment is required when changes alter the normative core of the discipline.

This includes:

- Modifications to formal definitions in **Foundations**.
- Changes to the **Metamodel**.
- Changes to transformation **Plays**.
- Any alteration that affects validity conditions.

Major versions are immutable once released.

Upon release of a new major version:

- The previous major version is archived.
- The new major version becomes the current reference.


## Minor version increments

A minor version increment is required for changes that do not alter the normative core but affect interpretation, explanation, or guidance.

This includes:

- Clarifications within Foundations that do not change validity conditions.
- Changes to Motivation, Guidelines, or Resources.
- Additions of informative material.
- Structural refinements that do not modify normative meaning.

Minor versions apply to the current major version and are recorded with an explicit version note.


## Patch increments

Patch increments are reserved for editorial corrections that do not affect meaning.

This includes:

- Typographical errors.
- Formatting corrections.
- Broken links.
- Non-substantive editorial fixes.

Patches do not introduce normative or interpretive change and may be applied without separate release announcements.


## Preview and forthcoming versions

Work on forthcoming major revisions is developed separately from the current released version.

A preview of the forthcoming major version may be made available under a dedicated path (e.g., `/next`).

Preview versions are not normative references. Normative claims must refer to a released major version.


## Archival and citation

All released major versions remain archived and accessible.

Normative claims, compliance assessments, and scholarly references must specify the major version to which they refer.

Minor and patch increments do not change the major version identifier.


## Summary

The guidebook follows a structured MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning model.

- Major increments apply when the normative core defined in Foundations changes.
- Minor increments apply to clarifications or non-normative content.
- Patch increments apply only to editorial corrections that do not affect meaning.

Major versions are immutable once released and remain archived. Normative claims must reference a released major version.

This model preserves normative stability while allowing controlled evolution of the guidebook.
