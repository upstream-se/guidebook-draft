> This page defines the principles that guide structural, conceptual, and governance decisions.

> ⚠ Warning  
> This page is not yet specified.  Its structural position is defined, but its content has not been developed.


## Principles

> ■ Principle — Contextual Indexing
Intermediate pages must integrate structural indexing into conceptually meaningful sections rather than relying on fixed structural labels.

> ■ Principle — Conceptual Node Integrity
A page must exist in the primary tree only if it has independent conceptual significance.
