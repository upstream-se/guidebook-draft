# Constitutional foundations

> This page defines the constitutional basis of the guidebook, including its identity, scope, decision principles, and authority model.

The constitutional foundations establish the legitimacy and normative boundaries of the guidebook as an institutional artifact.

They clarify why the guidebook exists, what it governs, how decisions are justified, and who holds ultimate authority over its evolution.  This layer is stable and rarely modified, as it defines the enduring framework within which all other governance domains operate.


## Constitutional scope

The constitutional layer regulates:

- The mission and purpose of the guidebook.
- The boundaries of its subject matter.
- The principles guiding structural and conceptual decisions.
- The allocation of authority and responsibility.

These foundations constrain and orient all structural, editorial, operational, and lifecycle governance decisions.
