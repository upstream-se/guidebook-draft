# Guidebook governance

> This page defines the governance framework that regulates the structure, authorship, evolution, and authority of the guidebook.

The guidebook is a governed intellectual artifact.  Its coherence, precision, structural integrity, and controlled evolution depend on a clearly defined governance framework.

Guidebook governance establishes the institutional rules that apply to all pages.  It separates constitutional authority, structural modeling, editorial discipline, operational control, and lifecycle assurance into distinct but coordinated layers.

This framework ensures deliberate evolution, conceptual consistency, and traceable authority.


## Governance framework

The governance framework is organized into five coordinated domains.  Each domain regulates a distinct dimension of the guidebook artifact.

## Contained Pages

This section enumerates the pages directly contained within this page.
