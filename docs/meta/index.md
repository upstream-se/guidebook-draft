# Meta-Governance

This part governs the guidebook itself.  This meta layer defines how guidebook pages are structured, authored, reviewed, evolved, and maintained.

Meta-governance ensures:

- Conceptual coherence.
- Terminological precision.
- Structural integrity.
- Controlled evolution.
- Traceable authority.

It is not ancillary documentation.  It is the governance framework of the guidebook.


# Meta-Governance Domains

The meta layer is structured into the following domains.


## 1. Charter

Defines the identity and normative boundaries of the guidebook, including mission, scope, decision principles, and non-goals.


## 2. Information architecture

Defines how knowledge is organized and navigated, including structural topology, concept graph conventions, cross-linking rules, and navigation policies.


## 3. Content model

Defines page types, required sections, epistemic roles, and stability levels.


## 4. Editorial standards

Defines terminology governance, naming conventions, language modality, formatting rules, and citation policy.


## 5. Contribution workflow

Defines change classes, review mechanisms, approval requirements, and escalation paths.


## 6. Roles and authority

Defines governance actors and decision rights.


## 7. Quality assurance

Defines structural validation, consistency checks, drift detection, and release criteria.


## 8. Release and versioning

Defines versioning model, deprecation rules, change log discipline, and publication cadence.


## 9. Provenance and traceability

Defines source registry rules, interpretation notes, and decision logs.


## 10. Tooling and repository operations

Defines repository structure, branching strategy, automation rules, and CI policies.


# Control levels

Each meta artifact is classified by control level:

- **Policy** — Normative and enforceable.
- **Standard** — Strongly expected practice.
- **Guideline** — Recommended but context-dependent.
- **Template** — Canonical structural artifact.
- **Example** — Illustrative and non-binding.
- **Log** — Historical record.

Control levels clarify authority and prevent over-rigidity.

# Current Policies

The following policies are currently formalized:

- **Navigation Policy** — Rules governing the “Where to Go Next” section of all conceptual and analytical pages.

Additional policies within the domains above are expected to evolve without altering this structural taxonomy.
