# Guidebook contributor guide

> This page defines the governance framework that regulates the structure, authorship, evolution, and authority of the guidebook.

The guidebook is a governed intellectual artifact.  Its coherence, precision, structural integrity, and controlled evolution depend on a clearly defined governance framework.

This governance framework separates constitutional foundations, structural rules, editorial discipline, operational control, and lifecycle governance into distinct but coordinated domains.  It ensures deliberate evolution, conceptual consistency, and traceable authority.


## Governance domains

- **[Constitutional foundations](./constitutional-foundations/)**  
  Defines the constitutional basis of the guidebook, including its identity, scope, decision principles, and authority model.

- **[Structural governance](./structural-governance/)**  
  Defines the structural rules that govern how the guidebook is organized, modeled, and navigated.

- **[Editorial governance](./editorial-governance/)**  
  Defines the standards that govern terminology, expression, and documentation discipline.

- **[Operational governance](./operational-governance/)**  
  Defines the processes and decision rights that govern how changes are proposed, reviewed, and approved.

- **[Lifecycle governance](./lifecycle-governance/)**  
  Defines the rules that govern versioning, deprecation, release discipline, and long-term integrity.
