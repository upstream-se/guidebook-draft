# Meta-Governance

This section governs the guidebook itself.

The guidebook defines concepts, lenses, and analytical families for software governance.  
The meta layer defines how those artifacts are structured, authored, reviewed, evolved, and maintained.

Meta-governance ensures:

- Conceptual coherence.
- Terminological precision.
- Structural integrity.
- Controlled evolution.
- Traceable authority.

It is not ancillary documentation.  
It is the governance framework of the governance artifact.

# Meta-Governance Domains

The meta layer is structured into the following domains.

## 1. System Charter

Defines the identity and normative boundaries of the guidebook, including mission, scope, decision principles, and non-goals.

## 2. Information Architecture

Defines how knowledge is organized and navigated, including structural topology, concept graph conventions, cross-linking rules, and navigation policies.

## 3. Content Model

Defines page types, required sections, epistemic roles, and stability levels.

## 4. Editorial Standards

Defines terminology governance, naming conventions, language modality, formatting rules, and citation policy.

## 5. Contribution Workflow

Defines change classes, review mechanisms, approval requirements, and escalation paths.

## 6. Roles and Authority

Defines governance actors and decision rights.

## 7. Quality Assurance

Defines structural validation, consistency checks, drift detection, and release criteria.

## 8. Release and Versioning

Defines versioning model, deprecation rules, change log discipline, and publication cadence.

## 9. Provenance and Traceability

Defines source registry rules, interpretation notes, and decision logs.

## 10. Tooling and Repository Operations

Defines repository structure, branching strategy, automation rules, and CI policies.

# Control Levels

Each meta artifact is classified by control level:

- **Policy** — Normative and enforceable.
- **Standard** — Strongly expected practice.
- **Guideline** — Recommended but context-dependent.
- **Template** — Canonical structural artifact.
- **Example** — Illustrative and non-binding.
- **Log** — Historical record.

Control levels clarify authority and prevent over-rigidity.

# Current Policies

The following policies are currently formalized:

- **Navigation Policy** — Rules governing the “Where to Go Next” section of all conceptual and analytical pages.

Additional policies within the domains above are expected to evolve without altering this structural taxonomy.
