# Guidebook governance

> This page defines the governance framework that regulates the structure, authorship, evolution, and authority of the guidebook.

The guidebook is a governed intellectual artifact.  Its coherence, precision, structural integrity, and controlled evolution depend on a clearly defined governance framework.

Guidebook governance establishes the institutional rules that apply to all pages.  It separates constitutional authority, structural modeling, editorial discipline, operational control, and lifecycle assurance into distinct but coordinated layers.

This framework ensures deliberate evolution, conceptual consistency, and traceable authority.


## Governance framework

The governance framework is organized into five coordinated domains.  Each domain regulates a distinct dimension of the guidebook artifact.


### Constitutional foundations

- **[Charter](./constitutional-foundations/charter.md)** — Defines the identity, mission, and normative boundaries of the guidebook.

- **[Scope and non-goals](./constitutional-foundations/scope-and-non-goals.md)** — Clarifies what the guidebook does and does not attempt to cover.

- **[Decision principles](./constitutional-foundations/decision-principles.md)** — Establishes the criteria guiding structural and conceptual decisions.

- **[Authority model](./constitutional-foundations/authority-model.md)** — Defines governance actors and ultimate decision rights.

### Structural governance

- **[Information architecture](./structural-governance/information-architecture/index.md)** — Defines the structural topology, navigation model, and relational conventions.

- **[Content model](./structural-governance/content-model.md)** — Defines page types, required sections, and structural obligations.

- **[Concept taxonomy](./structural-governance/concept-taxonomy.md)** — Defines classification rules for conceptual entities.

- **[Provenance and traceability](./structural-governance/provenance-and-traceability.md)** — Defines how sources and interpretative decisions are recorded.


### Editorial governance

- **[Editorial standards](./editorial-governance/editorial-standards/index.md)** — Defines language modality, formatting rules, and expression discipline.

- **[Terminology governance](./editorial-governance/terminology-governance.md)** — Regulates vocabulary precision and controlled definitions.

- **[Citation and source policy](./editorial-governance/citation-and-source-policy.md)** — Defines referencing rules and citation discipline.

- **[Control levels](./editorial-governance/control-levels.md)** — Defines normative strength categories (Policy, Standard, Guideline, etc.).

- **[Quality assurance](./editorial-governance/quality-assurance.md)** — Defines consistency checks and structural validation mechanisms.


### Operational Governance

- **[Contribution workflow](./operational-governance/contribution-workflow.md)** — Defines how changes are proposed and processed.

- **[Roles and decision rights](./operational-governance/roles-and-decision-rights.md)** — Defines review authority and approval responsibilities.

- **[Change classification](./operational-governance/change-classification.md)** — Defines categories of change and required levels of scrutiny.

- **[Review and approval mechanisms](./operational-governance/review-and-approval-mechanisms.md)** — Defines validation and escalation processes.


### Lifecycle governance

- **[Release and versioning model](./lifecycle-governance/release-and-versioning-model.md)** — Defines version structure and publication cadence.

- **[Deprecation policy](./lifecycle-governance/deprecation-policy.md)** — Defines how concepts and rules are retired.

- **[Change log discipline](./lifecycle-governance/change-log-discipline.md)** — Defines how modifications are documented.

- **[Drift detection and structural audits](./lifecycle-governance/drift-detection-and-structural-audits.md)** — Defines periodic structural integrity checks.

- **[Tooling and repository operations](./lifecycle-governance/tooling-and-repository-operations.md)** — Defines repository structure and automation rules.
