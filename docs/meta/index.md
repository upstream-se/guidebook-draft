# Guidebook governance

> This page defines the governance framework that regulates the structure, authorship, evolution, and authority of the guidebook.

The guidebook is a governed intellectual artifact.  Its coherence, precision, structural integrity, and controlled evolution depend on a clearly defined governance framework.

Guidebook governance establishes the institutional rules that apply to all pages.  It separates constitutional foundations, structural rules, editorial discipline, operational control, and lifecycle governance into distinct but coordinated domains.

This framework ensures deliberate evolution, conceptual consistency, and traceable authority.


## Governance domains

- **[Constitutional foundations](./constitutional-foundations/)**  
  Defines the identity and normative boundaries of the guidebook.

- **[Structural governance](./structural-governance/)**

- **[Editorial governance](./editorial-governance/)**  
  Defines expression discipline, terminology control, and documentation standards.

- **[Operational governance](./operational-governance/)**
