# Guidebook governance

> This page defines the governance framework that regulates the structure, authorship, evolution, and authority of the guidebook.

The guidebook is a governed intellectual artifact.  Its coherence, precision, structural integrity, and controlled evolution depend on a clearly defined governance framework.

This governance framework separates constitutional foundations, structural rules, editorial discipline, operational control, and lifecycle governance into distinct but coordinated domains.  It ensures deliberate evolution, conceptual consistency, and traceable authority.


## Governance domains

- **[Structural governance](./structural-governance/)**

- **[Operational governance](./operational-governance/)**
  Defines the processes and decision rights that govern how changes are proposed, reviewed, and approved.

- **[Lifecycle governance](./lifecycle-governance/)**
