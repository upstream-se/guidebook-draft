# Editorial governance

> This page defines the standards governing terminology, language, formatting, referencing, and stylistic discipline in the guidebook.

Editorial governance ensures consistency of expression across the guidebook.  It regulates how concepts are named, how definitions are written, how normative statements are expressed, and how references are presented.

This domain preserves linguistic precision and stylistic coherence.  It prevents ambiguity, redundancy, uncontrolled variation, and stylistic drift.


## Scope

Editorial governance regulates:

- Terminology and naming discipline.
- Abbreviation and acronym usage.
- Normative and informative language.
- Definition writing conventions.
- Formatting and micro-typographic rules.
- Callout semantics and visual conventions.
- Cross-reference and linking discipline.
- Version annotations within pages.
- Citation and attribution practices.
- Explicit editorial prohibitions.

It does not define conceptual structure.  It governs how that structure is expressed.
