# Callout Standard

> This page defines the normative system for structured callouts used throughout the guidebook.

Callouts provide a controlled mechanism for expressing structured statements, formal classifications, and lifecycle annotations.  The system is intentionally minimal, academically neutral, and symbolically disciplined.


## Page descriptor callout

Every page must begin with a descriptor callout immediately after the H1 title.

Format:

> This page defines ...

Rules:

- No symbol.  
- No title.  
- Single sentence.  
- Describes the purpose of the page.  
- Reused when referencing the page elsewhere.  

Example:

> This page defines the governance framework of the guidebook.

The descriptor callout is mandatory for all pages.


## Structured callouts

Structured callouts use the filled square symbol.

Symbol:

■

Format:

> ■ **Title**  
> Content...

Common titles include:

- Definition  
- Principle   

Example:

> ■ **Definition**  
> A software system is ...

The square symbol is uniform across all structured callouts.  The title determines semantic meaning.


## Versioning callouts

Version annotations use the empty square symbol.

Symbol:

□

Format:

> □ **Since v2.3**  
> Complementary links were removed from the final navigation section.

Other acceptable forms:

> □ **Introduced in v1.0**  
> ...

> □ **Amended in v2.4**  
> ...

Version callouts:

- Must specify the version.  
- Must appear immediately after the affected statement or section.  
- Must not introduce new normative content.  
- Serve as historical annotations.  


## Warning callouts

Warnings use the warning symbol.

Symbol:

⚠

Format:

> ⚠ **Warning**  
> This page is under active construction.

Warnings are reserved for:

- Structural instability.  
- Substantial incompleteness.  
- Transitional states.  

Warnings must be rare and temporary.


## Deprecation callouts

Deprecated content is explicitly marked.

Symbol:

⛔

Format:

> ⛔ **Deprecated since v2.1**  
> This concept is retained for traceability and should not be used in new material.

Deprecation callouts must include the version in which deprecation occurred.


## Usage Discipline

The following rules apply:

1. Do not stack more than two callouts consecutively.  
2. Do not use callouts for stylistic emphasis.  
3. Place callouts immediately after the section or paragraph they formalize.  
4. Use consistent titles across the guidebook.  
5. Do not mix structured and version annotations in the same callout.  
6. Maintain visual restraint.  

Callouts are structural instruments, not decorative elements.
