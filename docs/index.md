# Upstream Software Engineering Guidebook

> This page provides an overview of Upstream Software Engineering and its guidebook.

Upstream Software Engineering is the practice of epistemic governance of the intent of long-lived software systems.

Long-lived software systems are enduring socio-technical entities whose governing commitments persist across initiatives, teams, technological shifts, and organizational restructurings.  The knowledge that defines their intent — their commitments concerning scope, structure, constraints, and non-goals — is often fragmented or implicit.

When those commitments are not explicitly governed, intent fragments, drifts, or is repeatedly reconstructed.  Evolution becomes increasingly effortful and uncertain as the commitments that determine what must remain valid lose clarity and continuity.

Upstream Software Engineering addresses this fragmentation of intent.  It establishes durable and revisable commitments about scope and structure, clarifies authority and stewardship over those commitments, and defines the conditions under which change is considered valid.  It governs intent without prescribing implementation.

The discipline complements development methodologies, architectural practices, and operational frameworks.  It does not replace them.  Instead, it provides the normative reference within which downstream realization and long-term evolution remain coherent over time.


## About this guidebook

This guidebook is the reference articulation of Upstream Software Engineering.

It defines the conceptual and normative framework of the discipline, including its formal definitions, metamodel, and valid transformation patterns.  It distinguishes between normative content, which establishes what is considered valid upstream, and non-normative guidance, which supports enactment in practice.

The guidebook is structured to support clarity, interpretation, and disciplined evolution of the practice over time.


## Structure of the guidebook

The guidebook is composed of the following primary parts:

- **[Motivation](./motivation/)**  
  Introduces the problem space and structural rationale for Upstream Software Engineering.

- **[Foundations](./foundations/)**  
  Introduces the normative structure of Upstream Software Engineering.

- **[Guidelines](./guidelines/)**  
  Provides non-normative recommendations for enacting the discipline in practice.

- **[Resources](./resources/)**  
  Offers reusable materials that support learning, application, and dissemination of the discipline.

Each part fulfills a distinct epistemic role.  Motivation establishes the problem space, Foundations defines validity, Guidelines support enactment, and Resources provide supporting material.  While parts may be consulted independently, the overall structure reflects a progression from problem framing to normative articulation and practical support.


## Guidebook versioning and evolution

The guidebook evolves through structured versioning to ensure stability and traceability over time.

Each major version represents a distinct normative state of the discipline, defined by the **Foundations** page.  Once released, a major version is stable and remains a valid reference.  Subsequent changes that alter the normative core result in a new major version.

Minor versions refine or clarify content without changing the normative core.  Editorial corrections that do not affect meaning may be introduced as patches.

Normative claims and compliance assessments must identify the major version to which they refer, since prior major versions remain stable historical references.


## Contributing to the guidebook

The guidebook evolves through structured and governed contributions.

Proposals for clarification, refinement, extension, or correction are welcome across all parts of the guidebook. Changes to the normative core defined in the **Foundations** page undergo stricter review due to their impact on validity and versioning.

All contributions are evaluated according to the guidebook governance policies.  These policies define how proposals are submitted, reviewed, classified, and incorporated.

The guidebook is expected to grow as the discipline evolves.  The evolution of the guidebook is governed to ensure coherence and stability.

↗ See **[Guidebook governance](./meta/)** for the governance framework that regulates the structure, authorship, evolution, and authority of the guidebook.


## Intended audience

This guidebook is intended for **professionals** responsible for the definition, governance, and evolution of long-lived software systems.

This includes those who define structural commitments, establish system boundaries, govern architectural coherence, and steward long-lived systems across projects, teams, organizational restructurings, providers, and technological change.

Representative roles include enterprise and software architects, technical leads, principal engineers, product leaders, product owners, engineering managers, governance and portfolio roles, consultants, and roles within **software providers** or development organizations responsible for delivering and evolving systems on behalf of others.

The guidebook also serves **educators** and **researchers** in Software Engineering, organizational management and governance, and related fields concerned with system evolution and control.

It is further relevant to researchers and practitioners applying artificial intelligence to software development and evolution, as well as to **organizations adopting AI** in software construction, maintenance, migration, and long-term evolution, where AI-assisted tools and agents must operate within clearly defined structural commitments and governance constraints.

Familiarity with Software Engineering concepts, modern development practices, and organizational contexts in which software systems transcend individual projects, teams, or providers will facilitate effective use of this guidebook.


## How to read this guidebook

This guidebook distinguishes clearly between normative and non-normative content.  Its parts serve different epistemic functions within the articulation of Upstream Software Engineering.

**Foundations** defines the normative structure of the discipline and establishes what is considered valid upstream.  **Guidelines** provides non-normative recommendations for enactment in practice.  **Motivation** and **Resources** are informative and explanatory.

Normative claims, compliance assessments, and formal interpretation must be grounded explicitly in the **Foundations** of the corresponding major version.  Other parts support understanding and application but do not define validity conditions.
