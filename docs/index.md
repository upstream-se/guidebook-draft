# Upstream Software Engineering

*A guidebook for governing the development, operation, maintenance, and evolution of software systems*


## What this guidebook is

This guidebook presents a framework for **Upstream Software Engineering**:  
the discipline concerned with **governing** the conception, definition, development, operation, maintenance, and evolution  software systems **across the whole lifecycle**.

It addresses questions such as:

- What is the software system, beyond its current implementation?
- In which context does it exist and evolve?
- Which changes are valid, and which are not?
- How are decisions justified, recorded, and revisited over time?

The guidebook is **normative where necessary** and **guiding where appropriate**.  The distinction between these roles is explicit and intentional.


## What this guidebook is not

This guidebook is not:

- a development methodology
- a project management framework
- a set of mandatory documents or procedures
- a replacement for Software Engineering practices

It does not prescribe how to code, test, deploy, or operate software.  Instead, it focuses on the **intent, constraints, and transformations** that downstream activities are expected to respect.


## How the guidebook is organized

The guidebook is organized into four main **parts**, each with a distinct role.


### Motivation

The **Motivation** part explains **why Upstream Software Engineering is needed**.

It describes the problem space, the limitations observed in current practice, and the pressures that motivate the formulation of a dedicated discipline for governing software systems over time.

This part prepares the reader for the normative definitions introduced in the Foundations.


### Foundations

The **Foundations** part defines the **normative core** of Upstream Software Engineering.

It contains:

- **Discipline** — the formal definition of Upstream Software Engineering, including its scope and boundaries
- **Model** — the conceptual structures used to reason about software systems, their context, governance, and evolution
- **Plays** — the valid transformation patterns over the model

Foundations define **what is considered valid**.  Compliance is assessed against this part.


### Guidelines

The **Guidelines** part provides **recommended ways** to enact the Foundations in practice.

It contains:

- **Artifacts** — suggested carriers (documents) for model representations
- **Practices** — situational ways of executing plays in concrete organizational contexts

Guidelines are **not mandatory**.  They are meant to be adapted, combined, or replaced as needed.


### Resources

The **Resources** part provides **downloadable and reusable materials** produced as part of this initiative.

It includes white papers, research papers, books, templates, canvases, and other artifacts that support learning, application, and dissemination of Upstream Software Engineering.

Resources are **informative only** and have **no normative force**.


## How to read this guidebook

This guidebook is not meant to be read linearly.

Before engaging with Motivation, Foundations, or Guidelines, readers should consult:

**→ [How to Read This Guidebook](./how-to-read.md)**

That page explains:

- how the parts relate to each other
- how normativity is distributed across the content
- how different readers may navigate the guidebook
- how interpretation and compliance should be understood

It serves as the **reader’s contract** for the entire guidebook.


## Versioning and evolution

This guidebook evolves over time.

- Each released version is frozen  
- The current version reflects the latest accepted state  
- Future changes are introduced incrementally and transparently  


## Intended audience

This guidebook is primarily intended for:

- technical and product leads
- product owners
- software architects
- project managers/leads
- software development teams
- software operations teams
- enterprise architects
- consultants, auditing, and governance roles
- researchers and educators

It assumes familiarity with Software Engineering concepts and practices.


## How this guidebook relates to practice

Concrete applications of this guidebook — including:

- project-specific documents
- internal working notes
- customer deliverables

exist **outside** this guidebook.

The guidebook defines:

- the conceptual structures
- the valid transformations
- and recommended ways of working

Their instantiation belongs to the context in which they are applied.


## Where to go next

If you are new to the guidebook, proceed in the following order:

1. **[How to Read This Guidebook](./how-to-read.md)** — to understand interpretation and normativity  
2. **[Motivation](./motivation/index.md)** — to understand why the discipline is needed  
3. **[Foundations → Discipline](./foundations/discipline.md)** — to see how Upstream Software Engineering is defined  
4. **[Foundations → Models](./foundations/models/index.md)** — to learn the conceptual structures  
5. **[Foundations → Plays](./foundations/plays/index.md)** — to understand valid transformations  

Use **Guidelines** as a source of inspiration and operational advice.  

Consult **Resources** for reusable materials you can download or adapt.
