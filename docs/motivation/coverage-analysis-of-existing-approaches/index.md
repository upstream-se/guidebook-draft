# Coverage Analysis of Existing Approaches

This part presents a coverage analysis of established approaches to software development, management, and governance with respect to the upstream challenges identified in the **[Problem Space](../problem-space.md)** and articulated as **[Recurring Challenges](../recurring-challenges.md)**.

The purpose of this analysis is to examine how existing approaches address different portions of the upstream problem space.  Each approach is considered in terms of the kinds of challenges it is designed to handle, the forms of reasoning it supports, and the aspects of the problem space it does not explicitly address.  Taken together, this examination reveals a systematically under-addressed area that motivates the need for a distinct upstream discipline.


## How this analysis is structured

The pages in this part are organized around a shared analytical perspective and a set of recurring families of approaches.

Rather than evaluating individual methods or frameworks in isolation, the analysis focuses on how different classes of approaches reason about software systems, change, governance, and knowledge.  Each page highlights characteristic patterns of coverage and clarifies which dimensions of the upstream problem space fall within or outside their explicit scope.


## A comparative lens: governance and knowledge

A central element of this analysis is a comparative lens based on two dimensions:

- **Governance** — the degree to which constraints, criteria, and oversight are made explicit and shared
- **Knowledge** — the degree to which understanding of the software system, its intent, and its evolution is explicit, articulated, and inspectable

This lens is introduced and explained in detail in **[A Comparative Lens: Governance and Knowledge](./governance-knowledge-matrix.md)**.  It provides a common frame of reference for the analyses that follow and makes it possible to reason systematically about coverage across approaches.


## Pages in this part

This part of the guidebook is composed of the following pages:

- **[A Comparative Lens: Governance and Knowledge](./governance-knowledge-matrix.md)**  
  Introduces the analytical dimensions used to compare approaches and highlights a systematically under-addressed area in the governance–knowledge space.

- **[Methodologies and Process Frameworks](./methodologies.md)**  
  Examines development methodologies and process-oriented approaches, with a focus on execution, cadence, and local decision-making.

- **[Project and Portfolio Management Approaches](./project-and-portfolio.md)**  
  Analyzes time-bounded and initiative-centric approaches and their suitability for long-lived software systems.

- **[Architecture-Centric Approaches](./architecture.md)**  
  Discusses architectural practices as means of structuring software systems and the extent to which they address upstream concerns.

- **[Governance, Standards, and Compliance Frameworks](./governance-and-standards.md)**  
  Reviews formal governance and compliance-oriented approaches and the kinds of reasoning they enable.

- **[Tool-Centric and Documentation-Heavy Approaches](./tools-and-documentation.md)**  
  Examines approaches that rely primarily on tools or documentation to address upstream concerns.


## How to read this part

Readers are encouraged to begin with **[A Comparative Lens: Governance and Knowledge](./governance-knowledge-matrix.md)**, which establishes the analytical frame used throughout this part.

The remaining pages may then be read in any order, depending on the reader’s background and interests.  Considered together, they show how existing approaches address different portions of the upstream problem space and how, in aggregate, they leave a distinct area systematically under-addressed.
