# Coverage Analysis of Existing Approaches

This part presents a coverage analysis of established approaches to software development, management, and governance with respect to the upstream challenges identified in the **[Problem Space](../problem-space.md)** and articulated as **[Recurring Challenges](../recurring-challenges.md)**.

The purpose of this analysis is to examine how existing approaches address different portions of the upstream problem space.  Each approach is considered in terms of how governance is enacted and which aspects of the software system are primarily treated as governable.  Taken together, these analyses allow patterns of coverage to be observed systematically across approaches.



## How this analysis is structured

The pages in this part are organized in three stages:

1. Introduction of a comparative analytical lens,
2. Application of that lens to different families of approaches,
3. Examination of aggregate patterns across those analyses.

Rather than evaluating individual methods or frameworks in isolation, the analysis focuses on how different classes of approaches enact governance and what knowledge objects they explicitly govern.  This structured comparison makes it possible to reason about coverage in a consistent and comparable manner.



## A comparative lens: governance and knowledge

A central element of this analysis is a comparative lens that differentiates:

- **Governance mode** — how governance is enacted (operational, managerial, or epistemic),
- **Primary knowledge object governed** — what aspect of the software system is governed (execution, structural, or intentional).

These two dimensions form a 3×3 matrix that serves as a typology of governance configurations.

This lens is introduced and explained in detail in **[A Comparative Lens: Governance and Knowledge](./governance-knowledge-matrix.md)**.  It provides the conceptual frame within which subsequent analyses are conducted.



## Pages in this part

This part of the guidebook is composed of the following pages:

- **[A Comparative Lens: Governance and Knowledge](./governance-knowledge-matrix.md)**  
  Defines the analytical instrument used throughout this part, including the governance modes and primary knowledge objects governed.

- **[Methodologies and Process Frameworks](./methodologies-and-process-frameworks.md)**  
  Examines development methodologies and process-oriented approaches through the governance–knowledge lens.

- **[Project and Portfolio Management Approaches](./project-and-portfolio.md)**  
  Analyzes time-bounded and initiative-centric approaches using the same analytical frame.

- **[Architecture-Centric Approaches](./architecture.md)**  
  Discusses architectural practices and their characteristic governance configurations.

- **[Governance, Standards, and Compliance Frameworks](./governance-and-standards.md)**  
  Reviews formal governance and compliance-oriented approaches in terms of governance mode and knowledge object.

- **[Tool-Centric and Documentation-Heavy Approaches](./tools-and-documentation.md)**  
  Examines approaches that rely primarily on tools or documentation within the same conceptual frame.

- **Aggregate Coverage and Observed Patterns**  
  Synthesizes the preceding analyses to examine coverage patterns across the matrix.



## How to read this part

Readers are encouraged to begin with **[A Comparative Lens: Governance and Knowledge](./governance-knowledge-matrix.md)**, which establishes the analytical frame used throughout this part.

The subsequent pages apply this lens to different families of approaches.  After reading the individual analyses, the aggregate synthesis can be consulted to understand broader patterns across the governance–knowledge matrix.
