# Motivation

> This page introduces the problem space and rationale that motivate the need for a distinct upstream discipline.

Software systems do not emerge in isolation.  They are conceived, justified, governed, financed, constrained, and evolved within complex organizational and societal contexts.

Across industries and domains, recurring patterns of difficulty arise before implementation begins and persist throughout evolution.  These patterns concern decisions about direction, scope, responsibility, coordination, knowledge, and change.  They are not merely technical problems; they are structural features of how software-intensive organizations operate.

The Motivation part examines this problem space.  It clarifies why these difficulties are systemic rather than incidental and explains why addressing them requires an explicit upstream perspective.

This part is pre-normative.  It prepares the ground for the normative definitions introduced later in the guidebook without defining norms itself.


## Purpose of the motivation part

The purpose of this part is to:

- describe the context in which software systems operate and evolve
- surface recurring challenges observed across organizations and domains
- explain why these challenges are structural rather than incidental
- justify the need for an explicit upstream perspective

This part establishes **relevance and necessity**, not validity.


## Pages in this part

The Motivation part is composed of the following pages:

- **[Problem space](./problem-space.md)**  
  Describes the environment in which software systems exist and evolve.

- **[Recurring challenges](./recurring-challenges.md)**  
  Identifies patterns of difficulty that repeatedly arise in practice.

- **[Coverage analysis of existing approaches](./coverage-analysis-of-existing-approaches/index.md)**  
  Examines why existing methods, practices, and frameworks do not fully address these challenges.

- **[Why an upstream perspective](./why-an-upstream-perspective.md)**  
  Explains why the observed problems call for a distinct upstream focus.

- **[Scope and non-goals](./scope-and-non-goals.md)**  
  Clarifies what this motivation does and does not attempt to justify.

Each page addresses a distinct argumentative step.  While they can be consulted independently, the full rationale emerges most clearly when read sequentially.


## What this part does not do

This part does not:

- define **Upstream Software Engineering** as a discipline
- introduce the metamodel or plays
- prescribe practices or artifacts
- establish compliance criteria

All normative content is defined in the **[Foundations](../foundations/index.md)** part of the guidebook.


## How this part relates to the rest of the guidebook

The Motivation part provides the **contextual grounding** for the guidebook.

- It explains *why* upstream concerns matter.
- It does not explain *what* is valid or *how* to act.

Readers seeking formal definitions, validity criteria, or transformation rules should proceed to the **[Foundations](../foundations/index.md)** part after completing this section.


## How to read this part

This part is typically read:

- at the beginning, to understand the purpose of the guidebook
- when explaining the relevance of upstream concerns to stakeholders
- when assessing whether the guidebook applies to a given context

Readers already familiar with the problem space may choose to skim individual pages or return to them selectively.


## Where to start

If you are new to the guidebook, continue with:

- **[Problem space](./problem-space.md)** → to understand the environment in which software systems evolve

If you are revisiting this part, you may jump directly to the page most relevant to your questions.


While not recommended for first time readers, you can proceed to **[Foundations](../foundations/index.md)** to explore the discipline, its metamodel, and its plays.
