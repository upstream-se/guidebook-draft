# Motivation

> This page introduces the problem space and structural rationale for Upstream Software Engineering.

Software systems do not emerge in isolation.  They are conceived, justified, governed, financed, constrained, and evolved within complex organizational and societal contexts.

Across industries and domains, recurring patterns of difficulty arise before implementation begins and persist throughout evolution.  These patterns concern decisions about direction, scope, responsibility, coordination, knowledge, and change.  They are not merely technical problems; they are structural features of how software-intensive organizations operate.

The Motivation part examines this problem space.  It clarifies why these difficulties are systemic rather than incidental and explains why addressing them requires an explicit upstream perspective.

This part is pre-normative.  It prepares the ground for the normative definitions introduced later in the guidebook without defining norms itself.


## Purpose of this part

The purpose of the Motivation part is to establish relevance and necessity before introducing normative structure.  It frames the conditions under which an upstream discipline becomes meaningful.

Specifically, this part:

- describes the context in which software systems operate and evolve  
- surfaces recurring structural challenges observed across organizations and domains  
- explains why these challenges are systemic rather than incidental  
- examines the limits of existing approaches in addressing them  
- prepares the reader for the normative foundations that follow  

This part does not attempt to prove validity or prescribe action.  Its role is to clarify why upstream concerns deserve explicit treatment.


## What this part does not do

The Motivation part does not define the discipline formally.  It does not introduce the metamodel, articulate validity conditions, or prescribe practices and artifacts.

It does not establish compliance criteria.  It does not attempt to resolve the challenges it describes.  It does not provide transformation rules or operational guidance.

All normative content is introduced in later parts of the guidebook, where definitions, structural commitments, and validity constraints are made explicit.


## Relation to the rest of the guidebook

The Motivation part provides contextual grounding for the guidebook.  It explains why upstream concerns matter before defining what is valid or how to act.

The normative structure of the discipline is introduced in later parts of the guidebook.  There, definitions, structural commitments, and validity conditions are made explicit.

↗ See **[Foundations](../foundations/)** for the normative structure of Upstream Software Engineering.


## Pages in this part

The Motivation part is composed of the following pages:

- **[Problem space](./problem-space.md)**  
  Describes the environment in which software systems exist and evolve.

- **[Recurring challenges](./recurring-challenges.md)**  
  Identifies patterns of difficulty that repeatedly arise in practice.

- **[Coverage analysis of existing approaches](./coverage-analysis-of-existing-approaches/index.md)**  
  Examines why existing methods, practices, and frameworks do not fully address these challenges.

- **[Why an upstream perspective](./why-an-upstream-perspective.md)**  
  Explains why the observed problems call for a distinct upstream focus.

- **[Scope and non-goals](./scope-and-non-goals.md)**  
  Clarifies what this motivation does and does not attempt to justify.

Each page addresses a distinct argumentative step.  While they can be consulted independently, the full rationale emerges most clearly when read sequentially.


## What this part does not do

This part does not:

- define **Upstream Software Engineering** as a discipline
- introduce the metamodel or plays
- prescribe practices or artifacts
- establish compliance criteria

All normative content is defined in the **[Foundations](../foundations/index.md)** part of the guidebook.


## How this part relates to the rest of the guidebook

The Motivation part provides the **contextual grounding** for the guidebook.

- It explains *why* upstream concerns matter.
- It does not explain *what* is valid or *how* to act.

Readers seeking formal definitions, validity criteria, or transformation rules should proceed to the **[Foundations](../foundations/index.md)** part after completing this section.


## How to read this part

This part is typically read:

- at the beginning, to understand the purpose of the guidebook
- when explaining the relevance of upstream concerns to stakeholders
- when assessing whether the guidebook applies to a given context

Readers already familiar with the problem space may choose to skim individual pages or return to them selectively.


## Where to start

If you are new to the guidebook, continue with:

- **[Problem space](./problem-space.md)** → to understand the environment in which software systems evolve

If you are revisiting this part, you may jump directly to the page most relevant to your questions.


While not recommended for first time readers, you can proceed to **[Foundations](../foundations/index.md)** to explore the discipline, its metamodel, and its plays.
