# Motivation

This part explains **why Upstream Software Engineering is needed**.

It introduces the problem space in which software systems are conceived, governed, and evolved, and outlines the recurring difficulties that motivate the formulation of a dedicated upstream discipline.

The Motivation part is **pre-normative**.  
It prepares the reader for the normative definitions introduced later in the guidebook, without defining norms itself.



## Purpose of the Motivation Part

The purpose of this part is to:

- describe the context in which software systems operate and evolve
- surface recurring challenges observed across organizations and domains
- explain why these challenges are structural rather than incidental
- justify the need for an explicit upstream perspective

This part establishes **relevance and necessity**, not validity.



## Pages in This Part

The Motivation part is composed of the following pages:

- **[Problem Space](./problem-space.md)**  
  Describes the environment in which software systems exist and evolve.

- **[Recurring Challenges](./recurring-challenges.md)**  
  Identifies patterns of difficulty that repeatedly arise in practice.

- **[Limits of Current Approaches](./limits-of-current-approaches.md)**  
  Examines why existing methods, practices, and frameworks do not fully address these challenges.

- **[Why an Upstream Perspective](./why-upstream.md)**  
  Explains why the observed problems call for a distinct upstream focus.

- **[Scope and Non-Goals](./scope-and-non-goals.md)**  
  Clarifies what this motivation does and does not attempt to justify.

Each page has a specific role and can be read independently, though a sequential reading is recommended.



## What This Part Does Not Do

This part does not:

- define **Upstream Software Engineering** as a discipline
- introduce the metamodel or plays
- prescribe practices or artifacts
- establish compliance criteria

All normative content is defined in the **[Foundations](../foundations/index.md)** part of the guidebook.



## How This Part Relates to the Rest of the Guidebook

The Motivation part provides the **contextual grounding** for the guidebook.

- It explains *why* upstream concerns matter.
- It does not explain *what* is valid or *how* to act.

Readers seeking formal definitions, validity criteria, or transformation rules should proceed to the **[Foundations](../foundations/index.md)** part after completing this section.



## How to Read This Part

This part is typically read:

- at the beginning, to understand the purpose of the guidebook
- when explaining the relevance of upstream concerns to stakeholders
- when assessing whether the guidebook applies to a given context

Readers already familiar with the problem space may choose to skim individual pages or return to them selectively.



## Where to Start

If you are new to the guidebook, continue with:

- **[Problem Space](./problem-space.md)** → to understand the environment in which software systems evolve

If you are revisiting this part, you may jump directly to the page most relevant to your questions.
