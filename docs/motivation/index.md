# Motivation

> This page introduces the problem space and structural rationale for Upstream Software Engineering.

Software systems do not emerge in isolation.  They are conceived, justified, governed, financed, constrained, and evolved within complex organizational and societal contexts.

Across industries and domains, recurring patterns of difficulty arise before implementation begins and persist throughout evolution.  These patterns concern decisions about direction, scope, responsibility, coordination, knowledge, and change.  They are not merely technical problems; they are structural features of how software-intensive organizations operate.

The Motivation part examines this problem space.  It clarifies why these difficulties are systemic rather than incidental and explains why addressing them requires an explicit upstream perspective.

This part is pre-normative.  It prepares the ground for the normative definitions introduced later in the guidebook without defining norms itself.


## Purpose of this part

The purpose of the Motivation part is to establish relevance and necessity before introducing normative structure.  It frames the conditions under which an upstream discipline becomes meaningful.

Specifically, this part:

- describes the context in which software systems operate and evolve  
- surfaces recurring structural challenges observed across organizations and domains  
- explains why these challenges are systemic rather than incidental  
- examines the limits of existing approaches in addressing them  
- prepares the reader for the normative foundations that follow  

This part does not attempt to prove validity or prescribe action.  Its role is to clarify why upstream concerns deserve explicit treatment.


## What this part does not do

The Motivation part does not define the discipline formally.  It does not introduce the metamodel, articulate validity conditions, or prescribe practices and artifacts.

It does not establish compliance criteria.  It does not attempt to resolve the challenges it describes.  It does not provide transformation rules or operational guidance.

All normative content is introduced in later parts of the guidebook, where definitions, structural commitments, and validity constraints are made explicit.


## Relation to the rest of the guidebook

The Motivation part provides contextual grounding for the guidebook.  It explains why upstream concerns matter before defining what is valid or how to act.

The normative structure of the discipline is introduced in later parts of the guidebook.  There, definitions, structural commitments, and validity conditions are made explicit.

## Structure of this part

The Motivation part is composed of the following primary pages.  Each page represents a distinct argumentative step in the overall rationale.

- **[Problem space](./problem-space/)**  
  Describes the problem space in which software systems are conceived and evolve.

- **[Recurring challenges](./recurring-challenges/)**  
  Identifies and characterizes recurring structural challenges arising within the problem space.

- **[Coverage analysis of existing approaches](./coverage-analysis-of-existing-approaches/)**  
  Examines how established approaches cover the recurring upstream challenges.

- **[Why an upstream perspective](./why-an-upstream-perspective/)**  
  Explains why the recurring upstream challenges call for an explicit upstream perspective.

- **[Scope and non-goals](./scope-and-non-goals/)**  
  Clarifies the scope and non-goals of the upstream perspective.

Each page represents a distinct argumentative step.  While they can be consulted independently, the overall rationale becomes clearer when the pages are read in hierarchical order.  This part establishes the conceptual grounding of the guidebook and is therefore commonly read before proceeding to the normative foundations, though individual pages may also be consulted selectively when examining specific upstream concerns.
