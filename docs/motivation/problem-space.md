# Introduction

Before discussing challenges, limitations, or possible approaches, it is necessary to understand the **problem space** in which software systems exist and evolve.

Software systems are not isolated technical artifacts.  They are created, operated, and evolved within organizational, social, economic, and regulatory contexts, and they persist over long periods of time.  Their behavior, structure, and evolution are shaped not only by technical decisions, but also by human activity, organizational arrangements, and external constraints.

This page describes the **baseline conditions** under which software systems are conceived and evolve.  These conditions are not exceptional; they are common across domains, industries, and technologies.  They provide the background against which upstream concerns emerge, without yet characterizing them as problems or proposing solutions.

The purpose of this page is therefore **descriptive**.  It characterizes the environment in which software systems operate, establishing a shared understanding of the setting that motivates the rest of the guidebook.
