# Scope and non-goals

The argument developed in:

- **[Problem space](./problem-space.md)**  
- **[Recurring challenges](./recurring-challenges.md)**  
- **[Coverage analysis of existing approaches](./coverage-analysis-of-existing-approaches/index.md)**  
- **[Why an upstream perspective](./why-upstream.md)**  

motivates the need for an upstream perspective centered on durable epistemic governance of system-level intent.

This page clarifies the scope of that claim and delineates what it does *not* attempt to justify.


## Scope of the upstream argument

The upstream perspective is concerned with a specific governance configuration:

- **Epistemic × Intentional governance** —  
  the durable, inspectable, and revisitable stewardship of system-level purpose, assumptions, commitments, and non-goals across time.

Its scope includes:

- explicit articulation of system-level intent as a knowledge object,
- traceable linkage between intent and structural decisions,
- institutionalized mechanisms for revisiting assumptions and commitments,
- preservation of rationale across initiatives, teams, and provider transitions,
- governance of long-lived software systems beyond individual project boundaries.

The upstream focus therefore operates at the level of sustained system evolution, not at the level of isolated initiatives or local development practices.


## What this argument does not claim

The upstream perspective does **not** claim that:

- methodologies and process frameworks are insufficient for governing execution,
- project and portfolio management approaches are unnecessary for investment governance,
- architecture-centric approaches fail to articulate structure,
- governance and compliance frameworks lack value,
- documentation-heavy approaches are irrelevant.

Each of these families addresses essential dimensions of software development and organizational control.

The argument is not comparative in the sense of ranking approaches.  
It is structural: it identifies a configuration that is not systematically foregrounded as a primary locus of governance.


## No exclusivity claim

The upstream argument does not assert that epistemic × intentional governance is entirely absent from existing approaches.

Elements of intent articulation, decision documentation, architectural reasoning, and long-term alignment appear across families.  However:

- they are often secondary rather than primary objects of governance,
- they are frequently bounded by initiative lifecycles,
- they are not consistently institutionalized as durable epistemic processes.

The claim concerns systematic foregrounding and sustained institutionalization, not isolated presence.


## Not a methodological prescription

This motivation does not prescribe specific tools, frameworks, or lifecycle models.

It does not define:

- a development methodology,
- a project management framework,
- an architectural modeling notation,
- or a compliance standard.

Those design choices belong to the constructive part of the discipline.

At the motivational level, the objective is conceptual clarification:  
to make explicit what must be treated as governable if long-lived system intent is to remain coherent across time.


## Relationship to existing disciplines

Upstream Software Engineering is positioned as complementary to existing disciplines:

- It builds upon execution practices rather than replacing them.
- It leverages architectural reasoning rather than discarding it.
- It operates alongside managerial governance rather than competing with it.

Its distinct contribution lies in re-centering governance around the epistemic durability of system-level intent.


## Transition to Foundations

With the motivation clarified and the scope delimited, the guidebook now turns to conceptual construction.

The **Foundations** part introduces the metamodel and core concepts required to articulate system-level intent, structure, and governance relationships explicitly.
