# Scope and non-goals

The argument developed in:

- **[Problem space](./problem-space.md)**  
- **[Recurring challenges](./recurring-challenges.md)**  
- **[Coverage analysis of existing approaches](./coverage-analysis-of-existing-approaches/index.md)**  
- **[Why an upstream perspective](./why-upstream.md)**  

motivates the need for an upstream perspective centered on durable epistemic governance of system-level intent.

This page clarifies the scope of that claim and delineates what it does not attempt to establish.


## Scope of the upstream argument

The upstream perspective is concerned with a specific governance configuration:

- **Epistemic × Intentional governance** —  
  the durable, inspectable, and revisitable stewardship of system-level purpose, assumptions, commitments, and non-goals across time.

Its scope includes:

- explicit articulation and governance of contextual knowledge (assumptions about environment, stakeholders, constraints, and technological conditions) that frames system-level intent,
- treatment of system-level intent as a durable and inspectable knowledge object,
- traceable linkage between declared intent and structural decisions over time,
- institutionalized mechanisms for revisiting, re-evaluating, and, when necessary, revising assumptions and commitments,
- preservation and continuity of decision rationale across initiatives, teams, and provider transitions,
- governance of long-lived software systems beyond the temporal boundaries of individual projects.

The upstream focus therefore operates at the level of sustained system evolution, not at the level of isolated initiatives or local development practices.


## What this argument does not claim

The upstream perspective does **not** claim that:

- methodologies and process frameworks are insufficient for governing execution,
- project and portfolio management approaches are unnecessary for investment governance,
- architecture-centric approaches fail to articulate structure,
- governance and compliance frameworks lack value,
- documentation-heavy approaches are irrelevant.

Each of these families addresses essential dimensions of software development and organizational control.

The argument is not comparative in the sense of ranking approaches.  It is structural: it identifies a configuration that is not systematically foregrounded as a primary locus of governance.


## No exclusivity claim

The upstream argument does not assert that Epistemic × Intentional governance is entirely absent from existing approaches.

Elements of intent articulation, decision documentation, architectural reasoning, and long-term alignment appear across families.  However:

- they are often secondary rather than primary objects of governance,
- they are frequently bounded by initiative lifecycles,
- they are not consistently institutionalized as durable epistemic processes.

The claim concerns systematic foregrounding and sustained institutionalization, not isolated presence.


## Not a methodological prescription

Upstream Software Engineering is not proposed as:

- a development methodology,
- a project management framework,
- an architectural modeling notation,
- or a compliance standard.

It does not compete with Scrum, SAFe, PMBOK, TOGAF, COBIT, or similar families of approaches at the level of lifecycle design, delivery structure, or organizational control.

Rather than prescribing how software should be developed, funded, or documented, Upstream Software Engineering specifies what must be treated as governable if long-lived system intent is to remain coherent across time.

Its concern is not the orchestration of work, the authorization of initiatives, or the selection of modeling techniques.  
Its concern is the epistemic stewardship of purpose, assumptions, commitments, and their traceable relationship to evolving structure.

In this sense, it defines a locus of governance that can coexist with, complement, and constrain existing approaches — without replacing them.


## Relationship to existing disciplines

Upstream Software Engineering is positioned as complementary to existing disciplines:

- It builds upon execution practices rather than replacing them.
- It leverages architectural reasoning rather than discarding it.
- It operates alongside managerial governance rather than competing with it.

Its distinct contribution lies in re-centering governance around the epistemic durability of system-level intent.


## Foundations of the discipline

Having clarified the motivation, the guidebook proceeds to articulate the conceptual foundations of Upstream Software Engineering.

The **Foundations** part is structured in three layers:

- **The discipline** — its core propositions, positioning, and conceptual commitments.
- **The metamodel** — the formal vocabulary used to represent system-level intent, structure, context, and governance relationships.
- **The plays** — recurring governance patterns that operationalize epistemic stewardship of intent across evolution.

Together, these elements define the conceptual infrastructure required to treat system-level intent as durable, governable knowledge.
