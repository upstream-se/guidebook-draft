# Limits of Current Approaches

This part examines how established approaches to software development, management, and governance address the upstream challenges identified in the **[Problem Space](../problem-space.md)** and articulated as **[Recurring Challenges](../recurring-challenges.md)**.

The focus of this analysis is on capability rather than evaluation. Each approach is considered in terms of the kinds of challenges it is designed to address, the forms of reasoning it supports, and the aspects of the problem space it does not explicitly address. Taken together, this analysis reveals a systematically under-addressed area that motivates the need for a distinct upstream discipline.



## How this analysis is organized

The pages in this part are organized around a common analytical perspective and a set of recurring families of approaches.

Rather than examining individual methods or frameworks in isolation, the analysis focuses on how different classes of approaches tend to reason about software systems, change, governance, and knowledge. Each page highlights characteristic capabilities and the portions of the upstream problem space that remain outside their explicit scope.



## A comparative lens: governance and knowledge

A central element of this analysis is a comparative lens based on two dimensions:

- **Governance** — the degree to which constraints, criteria, and oversight are made explicit and shared
- **Knowledge** — the degree to which understanding of the software system, its intent, and its evolution is explicit, articulated, and inspectable

This lens is introduced and explained in detail in **[A Comparative Lens: Governance and Knowledge](./governance-knowledge-matrix.md)**. It provides a common frame of reference for the analyses that follow and makes it possible to reason about coverage and gaps across approaches.



## Pages in this part

This part of the guidebook is composed of the following pages:

- **[A Comparative Lens: Governance and Knowledge](./governance-knowledge-matrix.md)**  
  Introduces the analytical dimensions used to compare approaches and highlights a systematically under-addressed area in the governance–knowledge space.

- **[Methodologies and Process Frameworks](./methodologies.md)**  
  Examines development methodologies and process-oriented approaches, with a focus on execution, cadence, and local decision-making.

- **[Project and Portfolio Management Approaches](./project-and-portfolio.md)**  
  Analyzes time-bounded and initiative-centric approaches and their suitability for long-lived software systems.

- **[Architecture-Centric Approaches](./architecture.md)**  
  Discusses architectural practices as means of structuring software systems and the limits of architecture as a sole vehicle for governing evolution.

- **[Governance, Standards, and Compliance Frameworks](./governance-and-standards.md)**  
  Reviews formal governance and compliance-oriented approaches and the kinds of reasoning they enable.

- **[Tool-Centric and Documentation-Heavy Approaches](./tools-and-documentation.md)**  
  Examines approaches that rely primarily on tools or documentation to address upstream concerns.



## How to read this part

Readers are encouraged to begin with **[A Comparative Lens: Governance and Knowledge](./governance-knowledge-matrix.md)**, which establishes the analytical frame used throughout this part.

The remaining pages may then be read in any order, depending on the reader’s background and interests. Considered together, they show how existing approaches address different portions of the upstream problem space and how, in aggregate, they leave a distinct area systematically under-addressed.
