# Limits of Current Approaches

This part examines why many established approaches to software development, management, and governance struggle to address the upstream challenges identified in the **[Problem Space](../problem-space.md)** and articulated as **[Recurring Challenges](../recurring-challenges.md)**.

The intent of this analysis is not to dismiss existing methods or practices. Many of them are effective within their intended scope and have contributed significantly to the evolution of the discipline. The focus here is on their limits when confronted with the systemic problem space addressed by **Upstream Software Engineering**.

This critique is therefore comparative and diagnostic, not normative or prescriptive.


## How this critique is organized

The analysis in this part is organized around a common analytical perspective and a set of recurring families of approaches.

Rather than evaluating individual methods in isolation, the pages that follow examine how different classes of approaches tend to reason about software systems, change, governance, and knowledge. Each page focuses on a particular family of approaches and identifies characteristic strengths and limitations relative to the upstream problem space.



## A comparative lens: governance and knowledge

A central element of this critique is a comparative lens based on two dimensions:

- **Governance** — the degree to which constraints, criteria, and oversight are made explicit and shared
- **Knowledge** — the degree to which understanding of the software system, its intent, and its evolution is explicit, articulated, and inspectable

This lens is introduced and explained in detail in **[A Comparative Lens: Governance and Knowledge](./governance-knowledge-matrix.md)**. It provides a common frame of reference for all subsequent analyses in this part.



## Pages in this part

The following pages comprise this part of the guidebook:

- **[A Comparative Lens: Governance and Knowledge](./governance-knowledge-matrix.md)**  
  Introduces the analytical dimensions used to compare approaches and highlights a structurally under-addressed space.

- **[Methodologies and Process Frameworks](./methodologies.md)**  
  Examines development methodologies and process-oriented approaches, focusing on execution and local decision-making.

- **[Project and Portfolio Management Approaches](./project-and-portfolio.md)**  
  Analyzes time-bounded and initiative-centric approaches and their limits for long-lived software systems.

- **[Architecture-Centric Approaches](./architecture.md)**  
  Discusses the strengths and limits of architectural practices as means of governing software evolution.

- **[Governance, Standards, and Compliance Frameworks](./governance-and-standards.md)**  
  Reviews formal governance and compliance-oriented approaches and their emphasis on conformance.

- **[Tool-Centric and Documentation-Heavy Approaches](./tools-and-documentation.md)**  
  Examines approaches that rely primarily on tools or documentation to address upstream concerns.



## How to read this part

Readers are encouraged to start with **[A Comparative Lens: Governance and Knowledge](./governance-knowledge-matrix.md)** before reading the remaining pages. This lens establishes the conceptual frame used throughout the critique.

The remaining pages may be read in any order, depending on the reader’s background and interests. Together, they illustrate why existing approaches, while valuable, do not fully address the upstream problem space identified earlier in the guidebook.
