# Foundations

> This page defines the normative core of the Upstream Software Engineering Guidebook.

**Foundations** establishes the normative structures through which intent is governed within Upstream Software Engineering.

It formalizes the conceptual constructs that make governing commitments explicit, durable, and assessable for validity over time.

These structures directly address the structural insufficiencies identified in **Motivation** by providing the formal basis through which intent is articulated and governed explicitly.

↗ See **[Motivation](../motivation/)** for the problem space and rationale for a distinct upstream discipline.

The **Foundations** part is structured into three constitutive elements: the discipline, the metamodel, and the plays.


## Constitutive elements

### The discipline

**[The discipline](./discipline/index.md)** defines Upstream Software Engineering as a distinct field of study.

It clarifies:

- its object of governance,
- its locus of intervention,
- its relationship to existing families of approaches,
- and its normative orientation.

This section answers the question:  
**What kind of discipline is Upstream Software Engineering?**


### The metamodel

**[The metamodel](./metamodel/index.md)** introduces the formal conceptual structure that provides a shared vocabulary for articulating system-level intent, structure, governance modes, and their interdependencies.

It defines:

- the core concepts,
- their relationships,
- and the normative constraints governing valid configurations.

This section answers the question:  
**What must be explicitly represented to govern intent epistemically?**


### The plays

**[The plays](./plays/index.md)** define the valid transformations that may be performed on models conforming to the metamodel.

If the metamodel specifies *what exists* and *what relationships are valid*, the plays specify *how models may change* while remaining normatively valid.

A play is a named transformation between artifact spaces — such as external, upstream, downstream, and evaluation — with defined source(s), target, and transformation constraints.

Plays are not methodologies.  
They do not prescribe processes or sequences of work.

They define the legitimate moves within the normative space of the discipline.

This section answers the question:

**What transformations are allowed within upstream governance?**


## Reading order

The recommended reading sequence within **Foundations** is:

1. **[The discipline](./discipline/index.md)**  
2. **[The metamodel](./metamodel/index.md)**  
3. **[The plays](./plays/index.md)**  

However, each section can be consulted independently depending on the reader’s interest.


## Where to go next

It is recommended for first-time readers to proceed first to **[Motivation](../motivation/index.md)** to understand why the discipline is needed.

Once the motivation is understood, proceed to **[The discipline](./discipline/index.md).**

If preferred, return to **[Guidebook home](../index.md)** for an overview of this guidebook.
