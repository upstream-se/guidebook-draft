# Foundations

The **Foundations** part establishes the conceptual and normative core of Upstream Software Engineering.

Where **[Motivation](../motivation/index.md)** articulated the problem space and the structural asymmetry revealed by existing approaches, Foundations defines the conceptual constructs required to address that asymmetry explicitly.

This part is organized into three complementary components: the discipline, the meramodel, and the pkays.  They are brielfly described next.


## 1. The Discipline

**[Discipline](./discipline.md)** defines Upstream Software Engineering as a distinct field of study.

It clarifies:

- its object of governance,
- its locus of intervention,
- its relationship to existing families of approaches,
- and its normative orientation.

This section answers the question:  
**What kind of discipline is Upstream Software Engineering?**


## 2. The Metamodel

**[Metamodel](./metamodel/index.md)** introduces the formal conceptual structure that provides a shared vocabulary for articulating system-level intent, structure, governance modes, and their interdependencies.

It defines:

- the core concepts,
- their relationships,
- and the normative constraints governing valid configurations.

This section answers the question:  
**What must be explicitly represented to govern intent epistemically?**


## 3. The Plays

**[Plays](./plays/index.md)** define the valid transformations that may be performed on models conforming to the metamodel.

If the metamodel specifies *what exists* and *what relationships are valid*, the plays specify *how models may change* while remaining normatively valid.

A play is a named transformation between artifact spaces — such as external, upstream, downstream, and evaluation — with defined source(s), target, and transformation constraints.

Plays are not methodologies.  
They do not prescribe processes or sequences of work.

They define the legitimate moves within the normative space of the discipline.

This section answers the question:

**What transformations are allowed within upstream governance?**


## Reading order

The recommended reading sequence within Foundations is:

1. **[Discipline](./discipline/index.md)**  
2. **[Metamodel](./metamodel/index.md)**  
3. **[Plays](./plays/index.md)**  

However, each section can be consulted independently depending on the reader’s interest.


It is recommended for first-time readers to proceed first to **[Motivation](../motivation/index.md)** to understand why the discipline is needed.
