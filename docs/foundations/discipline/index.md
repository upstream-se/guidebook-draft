# The discipline

> This page defines the conceptual foundations and structure of the Upstream Software Engineering discipline.

The discipline is structured as a layered model.  Each layer depends on the preceding one and introduces a distinct analytical dimension: grounding, definition, ontology, stratification, dynamics, and constitutional articulation.  The order reflects conceptual dependency rather than pedagogical convenience.


## Structure of the discipline

### Conceptual grounding

- **[Underlying rationale](./underlying-rationale/index.md)**  
  Historical reconstruction and structural asymmetries motivating the discipline.

- **[Principles](./principles.md)**  
  Foundational commitments derived from that analysis.


### Discipline

- **[Upstream Software Engineering](./definition/index.md)**  
  Defines the discipline, its scope, its locus of governance, and its exclusions.


### Ontology

- **[Software system](./software-system.md)**  
  The governed socio-technical entity.

- **[Intent](./intent.md)**  
  Explicit commitments subject to governance.

- **[Context](./context.md)**  
  Conditioning environment of system-level intent.

- **[Stewardship and authority](./stewardship-and-authority.md)**  
  Allocation of responsibility and legitimacy over commitments.


### Stratification

- **[Upstream and downstream](./upstream-and-downstream.md)**  
  Distinction between governance and realization practices, including positioning relative to existing disciplines.

- **[Upstream, downstream, and mainstream](./upstream-downstream-mainstream.md)**  
  Full triadic structure including enacted production behavior.


### Dynamics

- **[Change](./change.md)**  
  Reinterpretation triggered by contextual shifts.

- **[Software evolution](./software-evolution.md)**  
  Structured cycles of reinterpretation and re-articulation across time.


### Constitutional foundations

- **[Reification and artifacts](./reification-and-artifacts.md)**  
  Relationship between normative knowledge structures and their instantiating artifacts.

- **[Ontological commitments](./ontological-commitments.md)**  
  Foundational commitments about systems, knowledge, and governance.

- **[Normative structure](./normative-structure.md)**  
  Structural validity rules and transformation discipline.
