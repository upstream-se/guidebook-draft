# The Discipline of Upstream Software Engineering

> ⚠️ **This page is under active construction.**  
> The conceptual structure is stable, but content is being expanded and refined.

This section defines **Upstream Software Engineering** as a discipline.

It does not introduce tools, templates, or practices.  
It establishes the conceptual structure, ontological commitments, and normative boundaries that make the discipline coherent and distinct.

Upstream is concerned with the **epistemic governance of software system intent across evolution**.  
The pages in this section progressively build that definition.

## Structure of this section

The discipline is articulated in four conceptual layers:

1. **Core conceptualization**
2. **Normative commitments**
3. **Change and evolution**
4. **Stratification and reification**

Each layer clarifies a different dimension of what upstream is and what it is not.

# Layer 1 — Core conceptualization

These pages define the fundamental stance of the discipline.

- **[Definition of Upstream Software Engineering](./definition.md)**  
  Provides the formal definition of the discipline and its primary locus of governance.

- **[Positioning within Software Engineering](./positioning.md)**  
  Situates upstream relative to established traditions, including project-centric, architecture-centric, and governance-centric approaches.

- **[Upstream and Downstream](./upstream-and-downstream.md)**  
  Clarifies the distinction between epistemic governance (upstream) and realization/operation (downstream).  
  This distinction is conceptual rather than chronological.


---

# Layer 2 — Normative foundations

Upstream is not a methodology.  
It is a normative stance grounded in ontological and epistemic commitments.

- **[Ontological Commitments](./ontological-commitments.md)**  
  Defines the core assumptions about software systems, intent, structure, context, and knowledge.

- **[Principles of the Discipline](./principles.md)**  
  Extracts foundational lessons from software engineering history that justify the need for upstream governance.

- **[Why a Metamodel and Plays](./why-metamodel-and-plays.md)**  
  Explains why the discipline is defined in terms of a metamodel (knowledge structures) and plays (valid transformations), rather than tools or prescribed artifacts.


---

# Layer 3 — Change and evolution

Upstream is inseparable from a particular understanding of change.

- **[Change and Context](./change-and-context.md)**  
  Defines change as variation in context that may trigger transformation of the system.

- **[Software Evolution as Epistemic Helices](./evolution-as-epistemic-helices.md)**  
  Presents software evolution as a structured, recursive, epistemic process in which intent and structure co-evolve across time.


---

# Layer 4 — Stratification and reification

Software systems are realized in artifacts, but upstream does not prescribe artifacts.

- **[Reification and Knowledge Domains](./reification-and-artifacts.md)**  
  Clarifies the distinction between knowledge structures (normative) and their concrete realization in organizational artifacts (contingent).

Upstream defines what knowledge must remain governable.  
It does not define which documents, tools, or templates must exist.

## Reading guidance

This section can be read sequentially from Layer 1 to Layer 4.  
However, readers primarily interested in evolution may start with **Change and Context**, and readers concerned with practice alignment may start with **Upstream and Downstream**.
