# The discipline

This section establishes the conceptual foundations of **Upstream Software Engineering** as a discipline.

It first clarifies why the discipline is needed and which principles shape it.  It then defines its core concepts, explains its understanding of change and evolution, distinguishes upstream from downstream practices, and articulates its normative commitments.

The pages below develop the discipline progressively—from conceptual grounding, through ontology and evolution, to stratification and formal structure.


## Conceptual grounding

- **[Underlying rationale](./underlying-rationale/index.md)**  
  Reconstructs successive eras of Software Engineering and extracts the structural asymmetries that motivate an upstream discipline.

- **[Principles](./principles.md)**  
  Articulates the foundational principles derived from that historical analysis and expresses the commitments that shape Upstream Software Engineering.


## Definition and core concepts

- **[Definition](./definition/index.md)**  
  Defines Upstream Software Engineering and clarifies its locus of governance.

- **[Software system](./software-system.md)**  Defines the governed entity as a socio-technical, long-lived system.

- **[Intent](./intent.md)**  Defines purpose, commitments, assumptions, constraints, and non-goals as explicit knowledge objects.

- **[Context](./context.md)**.  Describes the environment that conditions and constrains system-level intent.

- **[Stewardship and authority](./stewardship-and-authority.md)**. 


## Change and evolution

- **[Change](./change.md)**  
  Defines change and explains how contextual shifts trigger reinterpretation of system commitments.

- **[Software evolution](./software-evolution.md)**  
  Presents the upstream understanding of software evolution as epistemic helices—structured cycles of reinterpretation and re-articulation of intent and structure across time.


## Stratification and reification

- **[Upstream and downstream](./upstream-and-downstream.md)**  
  Distinguishes epistemic governance (upstream) from execution-oriented realization practices (downstream).

- **[Reification and artifacts](./reification-and-artifacts.md)**  
  Clarifies the relationship between normative knowledge structures and the artifacts that may instantiate them.


## Normative foundations

- **[Ontological commitments](./ontological-commitments.md)**  
  States the commitments about systems, knowledge, governance, and evolution adopted by the discipline.

- **[Normative structure](./normative-structure.md)**  
  Explains why a metamodel and formally valid transformations are required and why upstream does not prescribe specific artifacts.

- **[Positioning](./positioning.md)**  
  Situates Upstream Software Engineering in relation to Software Engineering, Architecture, Governance, and related fields.
