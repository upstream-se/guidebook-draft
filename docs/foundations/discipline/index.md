# The discipline

This section establishes the conceptual foundations of **Upstream Software Engineering** as a discipline.

It defines what upstream governs, how it understands change and evolution, how it relates to downstream practices, and which normative commitments shape its structure.

The pages below develop the discipline progressively—from core concepts, through change and evolution, to stratification and normative structure.


## Definition and core concepts

- **[Definition](./definition.md)**  
  Defines Upstream Software Engineering as a discipline and clarifies its locus of concern.

- **[Software system](./software-system.md)**  
  Defines what is governed: the software system as a socio-technical and long-lived entity.

- **[Context](./context.md)**  
  Describes the environment that conditions and constrains system-level intent.

- **[Intent](./intent.md)**  
  Defines system-level purpose, commitments, assumptions, and non-goals as knowledge objects.


## Change and evolution

- **[Change](./change.md)**  
  Defines what change is and how changes in context may trigger changes in the system.

- **[Software evolution](./software-evolution.md)**  
  Presents the upstream understanding of evolution as epistemic helices—structured cycles of reinterpretation and re-articulation of intent and structure across time.


## Stratification and reification

- **[Upstream and downstream](./upstream-and-downstream.md)**  
  Establishes the distinction between epistemic governance (upstream) and execution-oriented practices (downstream).

- **[Reification and artifacts](./reification-and-artifacts.md)**  
  Clarifies the difference between normative knowledge structures and the concrete artifacts that may instantiate them.


## Conceptual grounding

- **[Underlying rationale](./underlying-rationale/index.md)**  
  Presents the lessons extracted from software engineering history and research that shape the discipline’s design.


## Normative foundations

- **[Ontological commitments](./ontological-commitments.md)**  
  States the explicit commitments about systems, knowledge, governance, and evolution that the discipline adopts.

- **[Normative structure](./normative-structure.md)**  
  Explains why a metamodel and formally valid transformations are required, and why upstream does not prescribe specific artifacts and practices.

- **[Positioning](./positioning.md)**  
  Situates Upstream Software Engineering in relation to software engineering, architecture, governance, and related fields.
