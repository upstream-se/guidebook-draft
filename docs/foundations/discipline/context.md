# Context

A precise understanding of **context** is necessary to understand why intent exists and how it evolves.  Upstream Software Engineering does not govern the external world.  It governs the articulated knowledge of the world in relation to a long-lived software system.


## Definition

> **Definition.**  Context is the real-world environment within which a long-lived software system is embedded and whose conditions justify, constrain, or challenge its commitments.

Context is not an internal property of the system.  It consists of the external conditions under which the system exists and operates.

These conditions include, but are not limited to:

- organizational structures and authority arrangements,
- regulatory and legal frameworks,
- technological ecosystems and infrastructure environments,
- market dynamics and economic constraints,
- social and human practices,
- interoperability landscapes and partner systems.

Context exists independently of the system’s articulation of it.  However, only articulated knowledge of context becomes governable.


## What it is not

Context is not:

- a requirements document,
- a stakeholder list,
- a risk register,
- a market analysis report,
- or a technical environment description.

Such artifacts may describe aspects of context.  They do not constitute context itself.

Context refers to the actual external environment.  Upstream governance concerns the explicit understanding of that environment.


## Governable dimension

Context itself is not governable.  
It is external reality.

What is governable is:

- the explicit articulation of contextual assumptions,
- the declared interpretation of contextual conditions, and
- the stated relationship between those conditions and system commitments.

When contextual assumptions remain implicit, commitments lack traceable justification.  When contextual conditions shift without reconsideration of commitments, coherence erodes.

Upstream governance therefore requires that:

- contextual conditions relevant to commitments be articulated,
- assumptions be inspectable, and
- their linkage to intent be explicit.


## Context across time

Context is not static.  Organizational structures evolve.  Regulations change.  Technologies become obsolete.  Markets shift.  Partnerships dissolve.  Providers change.

Because context changes, commitments must be revisitable.

Three situations may arise when context shifts:

- Commitments remain valid.
- Commitments require reinterpretation.
- Commitments must be revised.

What must not occur is silent divergence between contextual reality and declared commitments.

Sustained alignment between contextual understanding and articulated intent is a condition for coherent evolution.


## Relation to other concepts

Context justifies and challenges **intent**.  Intent normatively constrains the realization of a **software system**.

The directional relationship is:

Context (as understood) → justifies → Intent → constrains → Realization.

When contextual knowledge changes, commitments must be consciously reconsidered.

This interplay prepares the ground for the pages on change and evolution.
