# Principles of Upstream Software Engineering

> ⚠️ **This page is under active construction.**  
> The structure is established. Lessons and principles will be progressively refined and formalized.

## Purpose of this page

This page articulates the principles of Upstream Software Engineering.

These principles are not arbitrary design choices.  
They are derived from the historical analysis presented in **[Underlying Rationale](./underlying-rationale/index.md)**, where successive eras of software engineering were examined in terms of what became governable, how governance was exercised, and what remained structurally under-governed.

The goal of this page is to:

- extract durable lessons from that historical analysis,
- identify recurring structural patterns across eras,
- and derive a coherent set of principles that justify the upstream discipline.

## Lessons learned across eras

This section consolidates the durable lessons extracted from each historical era.

The lessons below are provisional and will be refined.

### 1940s–1950s — Analytical Foundations

*(Lessons to be inserted.)*

### 1950s–1960s — Production Era

*(Lessons to be inserted.)*

### 1970s — Structural Control Era

*(Lessons to be inserted.)*

### 1980s — Engineering & Abstraction Era

*(Lessons to be inserted.)*

### 1990s — Architectural & Process Formalization Era

*(Lessons to be inserted.)*

### 2000s — Agile & Responsiveness Era

*(Lessons to be inserted.)*

### 2010s — Continuous & Platform Era

*(Lessons to be inserted.)*

### 2020s — AI & Epistemic Acceleration Era

*(Lessons to be inserted.)*

## Cross-era synthesis

This section will identify structural regularities across eras.

Questions to guide synthesis:

- Which dimensions of governance progressively strengthened?
- Which knowledge objects became increasingly formalized?
- Which governance configurations remained comparatively under-institutionalized?
- What recurring asymmetries appear across decades?

*(Synthesis to be developed.)*

## Derived principles of Upstream Software Engineering

From the historical lessons and cross-era synthesis, this section will articulate a set of explicit principles.

Each principle should:

- Be historically grounded.
- Address a structural asymmetry revealed in the timeline.
- Justify a core commitment of the upstream discipline.

Provisional structure:

1. Principle 1 — *(Title to be defined)*  
   - Rationale  
   - Historical grounding  
   - Governance implication  

2. Principle 2 — *(Title to be defined)*  
   - Rationale  
   - Historical grounding  
   - Governance implication  

3. Principle 3 — *(Title to be defined)*  
   - Rationale  
   - Historical grounding  
   - Governance implication  

*(Additional principles to be added.)*

## Relationship to other foundational elements

The principles articulated here will justify:

- the ontological commitments defined in **[Ontological Commitments](../ontological-commitments.md)**,
- the normative structure introduced in **[Normative Structure](../normative-structure.md)**,
- and the positioning of Upstream Software Engineering within the broader landscape of software engineering practice.
