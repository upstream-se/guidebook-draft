A clear understanding of what constitutes a **software system** is foundational to Upstream Software Engineering.  Upstream governs the intent of long-lived software systems.  
It is therefore necessary to define precisely what kind of entity can bear such intent.

## Definition

> **Definition.**  
> A software system is a long-lived socio-technical system centered on executable software, whose behavior, structure, and commitments persist across initiatives, teams, technological shifts, and organizational restructuring.

A software system is not merely a codebase or an application binary.  
It is a socio-technical construct in which executable software operates within and interacts with human actors, organizational processes, data flows, infrastructure, and technological environments.

The defining characteristics of a software system in the upstream sense are:

- **Executable centrality** — software is constitutive of the system’s operation, not incidental.
- **Socio-technical integration** — the system exists within organizational and human arrangements.
- **Long-lived continuity** — the system persists beyond individual projects, releases, or teams.
- **Historical accumulation** — structural decisions, constraints, and commitments accumulate over time.

A software system may evolve in architecture, implementation, technology stack, or deployment topology, yet remain identifiable as the same system through continuity of intent and commitments.

Longevity, not size, is the decisive attribute.  
A small but enduring system may require epistemic governance; a large but ephemeral project may not.

## What It Is Not

A software system, in this sense, is not:

- a single project,
- a temporary development effort,
- a repository snapshot,
- a deployment instance,
- or a short-lived prototype.

Projects construct or modify a software system.  
Instances run it.  
Repositories store representations of it.  
But none of these alone constitute the enduring system as a socio-technical entity.

## Governance Implications

The software system is the **bearer of intent**.

Because it persists across discontinuities—projects, iterations, personnel changes, provider transitions—it accumulates both structural and intentional history.  
This persistence makes durable epistemic governance necessary.

Without explicit governance of commitments, a long-lived system risks gradual divergence between its declared purpose and its realized structure.

Upstream Software Engineering therefore treats the software system not as a transient artifact, but as an enduring entity whose coherence must be preserved across time.

## Relation to Other Concepts

The software system does not define itself.

- Its **intent** defines and constrains what it is for and how it must be structured.  
- Its **context** conditions and challenges the validity of those commitments.

These concepts are defined in:

- **[Intent](./intent.md)**  
- **[Context](./context.md)**
