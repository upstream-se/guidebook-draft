## 1. Definition

*(To be drafted carefully as a concise but strong disciplinary definition.)*

This section will define Upstream Software Engineering as a discipline concerned with the governance of system-level intent, articulated as binding but revisable commitments justified relative to explicit knowledge of context.


## 2. What Is Governed

### 2.1 Intent as Commitments

This subsection will clarify that:

- Intent is not aspiration or preference.
- Intent is institutional commitment.
- Intent is binding for downstream realization but revisable upstream.

Intent has two dimensions:

- **Scope-intent** — commitments regarding what the system is meant to do (normative to requirements).
- **Structure-intent** — commitments and constraints regarding how the system must be structured (normative to architecture, technology choices, environments, automation, and design constraints).

Structure-intent constitutes the core set of decisions and constraints that must remain visible, respected, and explicitly revisited when obsolete.


### 2.2 Knowledge of Context

This subsection will clarify that:

- Context refers to the external reality within which the system exists (organizational, technological, regulatory, economic, social).
- Upstream does not govern context itself.
- Upstream governs articulated knowledge about context.
- Intent is justified relative to that articulated contextual knowledge.

Context itself is not governed; knowledge of context is.


## 3. The Intent–Context Relationship

This section will explain the directional relationship:

Context (as understood) → justifies → Intent → constrains → Downstream realization.

When contextual understanding changes:

- Commitments may remain valid,
- Or must be explicitly revised.

Silent drift between context and commitments constitutes a governance failure.

This prepares the conceptual ground for the pages on Change and Software Evolution.


## 4. Binding but Revisable

This section will clarify the core governance property of intent:

- Binding means downstream realization must conform to declared commitments.
- Revisable means upstream may explicitly re-articulate those commitments.
- Revision must be deliberate and visible.
- Unarticulated change constitutes erosion of governance.

Intent is neither immutable nor informal; it is governable.


## 5. Upstream and Downstream

This section will describe the stratification in prose before introducing any summary table.

Downstream concerns:

- execution,
- construction,
- deployment,
- operational control,
- artifact production.

Upstream concerns:

- stewardship of commitments,
- preservation of coherence across initiatives,
- governance beyond project boundaries,
- evolution of meaning across time.

A compact comparison table may be included as a summary at the end of the section.
