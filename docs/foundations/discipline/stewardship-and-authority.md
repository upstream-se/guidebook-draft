# Stewardship and Authority

> ⚠️ **This page is under active construction.**  
> The conceptual structure is outlined. Content will be progressively elaborated.

This page clarifies the structural necessity of stewardship and authority within Upstream Software Engineering.  
It follows the definitions of **Software System**, **Intent**, and **Context**, and makes explicit the institutional dimension implied by binding commitments.

## 1. Why Stewardship Is Structurally Necessary

**Core idea**

- Long-lived software systems persist beyond individuals.
- Intent consists of binding and revisable commitments.
- Commitments presuppose a subject capable of binding and revising them.
- Therefore, stewardship is not optional — it is structurally implied by intent.

Provisional thesis:

> Intent without a steward collapses into aspiration.

This section will argue that epistemic governance requires identifiable responsibility over commitments.

## 2. Authority as the Condition of Binding Intent

**Core distinction**

- Writing ≠ binding.
- Designing ≠ committing.
- Proposing ≠ governing.

Points to develop:

- Binding commitments require recognized authority.
- Authority is distinct from authorship.
- Authority legitimizes both preservation and revision.
- Without authority:
  - intent becomes advisory,
  - revision becomes drift,
  - governance becomes rhetorical.

This section will formalize authority as a necessary condition for epistemic governance.

## 3. Stewardship Across Discontinuity

Long-lived systems survive:

- project completion,
- team turnover,
- outsourcing,
- mergers and restructuring,
- technological shifts.

Implications to develop:

- Stewardship must be institutional, not personal.
- Authority must persist beyond role changes.
- Commitments must outlive authors.

This section connects durability of systems with durability of stewardship.

## 4. Governance Implications

Upstream Software Engineering therefore presupposes:

- identifiable stewardship of intent,
- explicit locus of authority over commitments,
- visible mechanisms for deliberate revision,
- continuity across organizational change.

Important clarification:

- This does **not** prescribe organizational structure.
- It asserts a structural requirement:

> If no authority is accountable for intent, epistemic governance cannot exist.

## 5. Relationship to Other Pages

This page will connect to:

- **Software System** — persistence and identity.
- **Intent** — binding commitments.
- **Context** — conditions of revision.
- **Change** — triggers for reinterpretation.
- **Upstream and Downstream** — authority versus execution.
